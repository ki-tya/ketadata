# Rentier, Rent Seeker, and Royalty-Bearing Digital Assets.

  

The terms "rentier" and "rent-seeker" are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to distinct concepts. The confusion may arise from the fact that both terms deal with the concept of economic rent, which is the excess return earned by a factor of production over and above what is required to keep it in its current use. However, while rent-seeker is a person who engages in rent-seeking behavior, a rentier is a person or entity that earns income primarily from the ownership of assets that generate economic rent, such as land, natural resources, or financial instruments.

  

A rentier can be an individual, a company, or even a country. Rentier income is different from income earned from productive activities such as labor or entrepreneurship, as rentier income does not involve creating new value, but rather capturing a portion of the existing economic surplus.

  

On the other hand, rent-seeker refers to a person or entity that engages in activities that seek to capture economic rent for oneself, usually by using political or market power. Rent-seeking activities can include lobbying for subsidies, tariffs, or other government interventions that provide an advantage to a particular group, or using anticompetitive practices to restrict access to markets. Rent-seekers may also engage in activities such as patent trolling, where they use the legal system to extract rents from others who are using similar technologies or products.

  

Rent-seeking behavior is often seen as unproductive and harmful to the economy, as it results in a misallocation of resources and a loss of efficiency. While rent-seekers can come from any sector of the economy, they tend to be concentrated in industries that are heavily regulated or that have a high degree of government intervention.

  

While rentier income is often associated with natural resources, it can also include income from financial assets or intellectual property, such as patents or copyrights. In contrast, rent-seeking behavior can occur in any sector of the economy, as long as there is an opportunity to capture economic rent.

  

In the kingdom of Economics, two distant cousins, Rentier and Rent Seeker, shared an affinity for "economic rent." However, their methods and societal impacts vastly differed. Rentier, the refined cousin, passively generated income through assets, thereby promoting innovation, investment, and the efficient allocation of resources. Rent Seeker, the cunning cousin, sought to increase wealth without creating new value, leading to detrimental consequences for society.

  

As the realm of cryptocurrencies expanded, the magical world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) emerged, bringing with it a fascinating new phenomenon: royalty-bearing NFTs. In this context, royalties refer to ongoing payments made to the original creators of NFTs each time their creations are bought or sold. This innovative approach has sparked spirited debates within the cryptocurrency community, with some arguing that these royalties are incompatible with Bitcoin ideals as they allegedly promote rent-seeking behavior. However, this contention is rooted in the confusion between rentiers and rent seekers.

  

The rentier model, embodied by royalty-bearing NFTs, is not intrinsically harmful. In fact, it incentivizes creators to develop innovative and valuable digital assets, driving economic growth and enriching the NFT ecosystem. The rent-seeking behavior, on the other hand, stifles progress and fosters inequality.

  

While there is a technical incompatibility between the rentier model and Bitcoin due to the decentralized nature of the latter, it is crucial to recognize that this incompatibility is not an ethical one. Bitcoin's decentralized principles may resist the centralized enforcement of royalties, but that does not inherently make the concept of royalties contrary to the cryptocurrency's ideals. In fact, integrating royalties within the NFT space can foster innovation and investment, ultimately promoting a more prosperous and creative digital landscape.

  

In conclusion, the argument that royalty-bearing NFTs are incompatible with Bitcoin ideals due to their alleged promotion of rent-seeking is based on an invalid conflation of terms. As informed cryptocurrency enthusiasts, we must recognize the distinction between rentiers and rent seekers, and understand that the technical incompatibility between the rentier model and Bitcoin is not an ethical one. By embracing the potential benefits of rentier models, we can contribute to the growth of a vibrant, innovative, and prosperous NFT ecosystem while remaining true to the core values of decentralization that define the Bitcoin world.
