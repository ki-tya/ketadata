**Coin Colonoscopy - A Diagnostic Exercise**

**Bitcoin’s value is far more advantageous to store than spend. Originally a medium of exchange, over time it has become a valuable asset, or “digital gold”. The currency’s (?)legal status as a commodity introduced the obligation to pay taxes on appreciation. Transactions are taxable events, further complicating widespread adoption. As a result, a more fundamental problem for the ecosystem has emerged: the way Bitcoin is used today imposes a limitation on the Bitcoin economy.**

**Slow or not, provided that adoption continues to grow, this is a natural stage on the path to maturity. Nevertheless, maintaining a reasonable pace of evolution creates better conditions for Bitcoin to succeed.**


**## Problem Diagnosis**

**The challenges Bitcoin faces were solved a long time ago within traditional finance, where instead of BTC, the participating value-stores are non-digital, like real estate or corporate equity. In Bitcoin’s case, there is a clear need for additional financial infrastructure to help users transact and utilize the stored value, however, developing such has proven challenging.**

**Bitcoin is a hard platform to innovate, and for good reasons - its functionality necessitates technical complexity. Sidechains have proven to be a viable gateway to innovation. Within the sidechain ecosystems, there are some use cases that require issuance of independent assets in order to extend Bitcoin functionality. But typically assets like that get flushed out and labeled as ‘shitcoins’.**  

**Let's look at the case of collateralized lending.**

**For the Bitcoin ecosystem to fully embrace a collateralized lending solution, it must stay true to the Bitcoin Standard. Consequently, unless someone figures out how to decentralize USD, the output of the transaction must be a decentralized stablecoin X that is guaranteed to have a peg to USD and its value backed by Bitcoin. For that to work, the volatility in the BTCUSD pair results in the need for another independent digital asset to absorb said volatility and secure the peg. This design requirement becomes an obstacle for the community due to their distrust of alternative coins.** 


**## Case History: Why Hate the Alts**

**If Bitcoin's larger mission is to unite people around a single measure of value and lessen overall dependence on centralized finance, it is understandable that Bitcoiners can't help but feel that significant progress is often thwarted or stalled by half-baked projects posing as novelties. The value that ‘shitcoins’ represent is regarded within the community as dubious and fleeting, and their growing prevalence trivializes Bitcoin's impact.** 

**Most Common irritants:**

1. **Altcoin projects often try to secure funding through intentional obscurity as a way to mimic scientific complexity and associate themselves with Bitcoin. Inadvertently or not, they deceive the public by taking advantage of the layman's lack of technical understanding.**

2. **Even well-intentioned projects often fall too far from the Bitcoin standard and the community's goals. Despite promising decentralization and transparency, the realization of these projects is often lacking.  Their functional fallacies and failures reflect unfavorably on Bitcoin.** 

3. **Successful altcoins that utilize PoW consensus mechanisms compete with Bitcoin directly for access to energy. Mining power is a zero-sum game by nature, and PoW altcoins detract power capacity from Bitcoin, thus reducing its security and influence.** 


**As a result, all altcoins are viewed as antagonistic agents. A principle that when taken at face-value becomes an additional harmful consequence that often goes unnoticed, but has significant impact because it inflicts damage from within. All independent value assets are *a priori* rejected, even those with the explicit goal and potential to further the progress of Bitcoin. This process resembles an ***autoimmune condition***: an off-target response that turns Bitcoin’s antibodies on the ecosystem itself.**

**## Treatment Plan**

  

**We suggest a new set of inscriptions for the "white blood cells" of the Bitcoin community. Instead of destroying 100% of the non-stable foreign actors, which proves to be the correct decision in more than 98 percent of cases, this criteria is for distinguishing the 2% encounters with non-inflammatory agents that enable healthy growth and well-being within Bitcoin - a new type of asset to filter out and let live,    a Bitcoin-Auxiliary Asset ($BAxA$).**

  

**The criteria laid out below are intended as a filter to identify $BAxA$s and keep them true to the cause as they emerge and develop.**

  

****Benevolence.****  **$BaXA$s should provide a clear value that strengthens one or more of Bitcoin's characteristics, expands the system, or adds necessary functionality.**

  

****Fidelity.****  **$BaXA$s should be tied to Bitcoin in an exclusive way. If a token bears a vital function in another ecosystem, which, in its turn, is a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem and provides an essential service to Bitcoin exclusively, it can be considered an extension of the Bitcoin ecosystem .** 

  

****Integrity.****  **$BAxA$ chains should uphold the "Five Pillars." - Open, Public, Borderless, Neutral, and Censorship-resistant. $BAxA$s should either be decentralized and trustless to an extent measurable against Bitcoin, or they should not expose Bitcoin users to the risks of centralization they introduce.**

****Duty.****  **$BAxA$ should not be designed to fulfill the same market needs as Bitcoin. trade-able asset $BAxA$'s utility for the purpose of trading should be sufficiently different compared to Bitcoin.For example, any stablecoin will pass such criteria. On the opposite side of the trading spectrum, an asset designed to be highly volatile compared to Bitcoin will also pass. Likewise, a Bitcoin derivative or an asset issued on a Bitcoin smart contract will fall under the same category.**

  

****Humility.****  **$BAxA$ should not compete with Bitcoin for vital resources, such as electricity.**

  

****Fatality.****   ***"The Moor has done his work, the Moor can go."* If the utility that $BAxA$ provides to Bitcoin is limited in time, it would be preferable for $BAxA$ to have a sunset algorithm after its provided utility becomes obsolete. If a coin X exists because the Bitcoin mainchain lacks a certain `OP_CODE`, to fulfill this criterion, X will have a path to retirement if/when such `OP_CODE` is enabled. In other words, the value of a $BAxA$ is not in the fact of its existence but its function.**

  

**## Anamnesis Morbi**

  

**Bitcoin as an ecosystem needs to grow to achieve its goals, this growth is significantly stalled, partly due to internal conditions. While altcoins are often at the center of the community's frustrations, and for the right reasons, there are technologies that could prove instrumental to the cause.**

  

**The framework provided aims to develop an internal discourse on the matter, considering various axes of alignment and divergence. Of course, all rules must allow for the possibility of exceptions. But it must be apparent that the new utility significantly outweighs any potential harm that could be inflicted by not fulfilling the $BAxA$ criteria.** 

  

  

**## Non-Medical Conclusion**

  

**Of course, we are writing this with a motive in mind.  As soon as we started building a bitcoin-backed USD-pegged stablecoin for the Bitcoin ecosystem, we realized we had to have a balance coin. It took us a lot of research to become convinced that this is the best way to do it. Once we put the design together, we started showing it around. We were prepared for the pushback – we also were ready to see most of the pushback from our closest friends in the industry, but… There is no "but." We knew exactly what we were getting into, because we are a part of the same narrative.**

  

**Through navigating numerous conversations and explaining our point and vision, we have realized that the challenge we are facing is bigger than what we are building – it is systemic, and it is the size of Bitcoin. And it is justified – it has emerged for the right reasons. The article that you just read is a way to begin solving the challenge, taking you with us along our thought path of the past year or so: how we faced the issue, how we have identified and explained it to ourselves, how we researched and conceptualized it, and how we came up with a simple and efficient framework to resolve it. We do not doubt that the community will come on board, we hope to convince you soon enough.**

**Michael Saylor, in his [interview](https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-standard-podcast-34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standar-d-f8e926834030) restated the solution for the Bitcoin economy: *"there's no reason why we couldn't get to a point where a billion people could borrow money against Bitcoin at 2% and then never sell the Bitcoin forever!*"**

  

**A key sector of the Bitcoin community is motivated by Bitcoin's potential to fulfill a larger mission to fix money and has little patience for those whose motivations they believe to be less than. Since 2016, there has been a 1500% increase in the number of altcoins on the market, with many projects undergoing minimal scrutiny prior to launch. Unfortunately, a lack of understanding of the technology combined with the susceptibility to get swept up in cultural trends has facilitated an environment in which these volatile assets run amok without much accountability. This is a point of frustration for many Bitcoiners, who feel that** 

  

**the value these coins represent is dubious, and their growing prevalence trivializes Bitcoin's impact. Considering the undeniable gravitas in Bitcoin's mission to unite people around a single measure of value and lessen overall dependence on financial institutions, it is understandable that Bitcoiners can't help but feel that significant progress is often thwarted or stalled by half-baked projects posing as novelties.**

**For example, Coins that use PoS are prone to fall victim to the issues described in the article "[On Stake and Consensus](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf)."[@Poe15]  Creators of such alts most often mitigate the impact by maintaining centralized control, a significant compromise, and divergence from Bitcoin's values.**

**RSK could be brought up as an example of the latter: even though their two-way peg bridge between RBTC and BTC is trust–minimized, not trustless per se, the sidechain itself is merge-mined, i.e., decentralized. As a result, users buying RBTC on the market enjoy**
