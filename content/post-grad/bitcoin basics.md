BITCOIN BASICS

A structured introduction to Bitcoin through key texts, thinkers, and critical lenses — moving from fundamentals to philosophy and mechanics.

CORE TEXTS
BITCOIN WHITE PAPER

https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-paper

By Satoshi Nakamoto (2008)

The original nine-page document that introduced a peer-to-peer electronic cash system using cryptographic proof instead of trust. It defines the architecture that allows two people anywhere in the world to send value directly, without banks or intermediaries.

Key concepts:

Decentralization

Proof-of-Work

Blockchain as a time-stamped ledger

UTXO (unspent transaction output) accounting



PHILOSOPHICAL CONTEXT
NICK LAND — CRYPTOCURRENT / CRYPTOCENE

https://etscrivner.github.io/cryptocurrent/

https://aksioma.org/pdf/sum10-2_cryptocene.pdf

Philosopher Nick Land treats Bitcoin as a techno-economic organism: an autonomous, self-governing system accelerating the decentralization of power. These essays are difficult but conceptually useful if you are interested in the intersection of cybernetics, capital, and computation.

Focus on the idea of Bitcoin as a system that thinks economically and evolves beyond human control.

TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC ESSAYS
ANDREW POELSTRA — ON STAKE AND CONSENSUS

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-Stake-and-Consensus-Poelstra/5fc38a9b1301cd65604e67e1a424a1241f66cecf

A cryptographer’s argument for Proof-of-Work as the only consensus system that creates objective truth through external cost (energy). Poelstra contrasts this with Proof-of-Stake, where authority risks becoming circular and political rather than physical.

NIC CARTER — INFRASTRUCTURE AND ANALYSIS

https://niccarter.info/

Carter writes about Bitcoin as infrastructure: a monetary network rather than a speculative asset. His essays clarify the relationship between mining, energy, and decentralization.

Suggested pieces:

The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption

A Most Peaceful Revolution

ANDREAS M. ANTONOPOULOS — “BUBBLE BOY AND THE SEWER RAT”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=810aKcfM__Q&ab_channel=aantonop

A lecture comparing fragile systems that hide from risk (“Bubble Boys”) to resilient systems that adapt and survive (“Sewer Rats”). Bitcoin is positioned as antifragile: strengthened by attack and failure.

SAIFEDEAN AMMOUS — THE BITCOIN STANDARD

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp4U5aH_T6A&ab_channel=LexFridman

An economic argument for Bitcoin as “sound money.” Ammous connects Austrian economics with digital scarcity, presenting Bitcoin as a long-term store of value that restores low time preference and monetary discipline.

CRITIQUES AND COUNTERPOINTS
DAN OLSON — “LINE GOES UP: THE PROBLEM WITH NFTS”

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g&ab_channel=FoldingIdeas

A comprehensive critique of crypto culture, blockchain speculation, and financialization. While focused on NFTs, it also reveals the social contradictions around decentralization, hype, and inequality.

MECHANICS AND VISUAL MODELS
CASEY RODARMOR — UTXOS AND WALLETS

UTXO stands for “unspent transaction output.” Every Bitcoin transaction consumes and creates discrete outputs, which function like digital coins.

Think of it as:

Each output = a specific coin

Wallet = a collection of keys to unlock them

Sending = signing and combining outputs into new ones

This model differs from traditional account balances and gives Bitcoin its unique traceable yet pseudonymous structure.

WHAT IS BITCOIN?

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency built on three principles: cryptography, consensus, and incentive. It replaces trust in institutions with verifiable computation.

The Blockchain
A public ledger storing every transaction in chronological order. Each block references the previous one, forming an immutable chain secured by cryptographic hashes.

Proof-of-Work
Miners compete to solve mathematical puzzles that require real energy expenditure. The first to solve adds a new block to the chain and receives newly minted Bitcoin as a reward.
This process ensures that adding data is costly and that the longest chain represents the most computational work done — thus the most valid record.

Decentralization
Thousands of independent nodes verify transactions. No single server or authority controls the system. Consensus is achieved through majority validation and shared rules rather than decrees.

Scarcity and Issuance
There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. The issuance rate halves roughly every four years (the “halving”), creating a deflationary structure analogous to gold scarcity.

Ownership and Keys
To hold Bitcoin is to control a pair of cryptographic keys. The private key signs transactions; the public key proves ownership. “Not your keys, not your coins” summarizes the system’s ethos.

Social Layer
Beyond the protocol, Bitcoin represents a cultural and philosophical shift: the belief that money can exist without the state, that code can enforce fairness, and that distributed systems can outlast centralized trust.

Bitcoin is both a network and an idea, a living experiment in digital sovereignty, incentive design, and human coordination.
