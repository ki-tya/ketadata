**Bitcoin Maximalism Is Dead, Long Live Bitcoin Maximalism**

"I don’t owe them anything," he said.

To hear prominent venture capitalist and essayist Nic Carter, [tell it](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/setting-the-record-straight-b4e1b415e7d9), there is a plague afoot in the land of cryptocurrency, its frontier overrun with an "orthodoxy" of undesirables "lashing out" – unrealistic, irrational – in their monogamous love of bitcoin[BTC](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/bitcoin-btc/) [-3.7%](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/bitcoin-btc/) and hatred of alternative cryptocurrencies and investment culture at large.

To give a brief recap of the offending drama, Carter, before last week enjoyed a vaunted status in the Bitcoin world, beloved for thoughtful provocations against the standard-bearers of high finance, his [creative defense of the protocol's mining mechanics](https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-americas-most-misunderstood-industry-opinion-1669892), and his masterful use of social media, where he [regularly earned plaudits](https://twitter.com/myspacetom/status/1382659678262362116) from anons and supermodels alike.

But all it took to upend the apparently delicate balance was a relatively small investment, in this case, news that his venture firm, [Castle Island Ventures](https://www.castleisland.vc/), had participated in funding an [authentication startup](https://www.dynamic.xyz/blog/gm-from-dynamic), one making use of the crypto/web3 wallet infrastructure.

PROMOTED

As Carter rightly pointed out [in his response to the uproar](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/setting-the-record-straight-b4e1b415e7d9), this shouldn't exactly have been news – his work in the industry has, since 2018, been more expansive than his support for Bitcoin, including the fund, a respected crypto analytics firm ([Coin Metrics](https://coinmetrics.io/)) and a popular crypto podcast ([On the Brink](https://onthebrink-podcast.com/)). That's not to say that Carter hasn't been selective with his image, or that the media hasn't been choice with his portrayal, his work often tailored for either a Bitcoin or crypto audience.

Whatever the reason for the imbalance between reality and perception, it quickly corrected, Carter earning mockery in memes too scandalous to be reprinted here, a public dredging that only worsened with Carter's [dismissive responses](https://twitter.com/GigaThad/status/1542099094990110721?s=20&t=0L3pYmLrwkkRNU9UkHBSJg), which sometimes evoked his position as a venture capitalist.


His crime? At a time when bitcoin's biggest champions – Jack Dorsey, Nayib Bukele, and Michael Saylor – are investing it all in the protocol, bearing down the might of their brands and nation in support, Carter was outed as against the party line in his equity investments, and his reaction to the protest was swift and emotional.

In a missive Thursday, he wrote:

"It’s clear that there’s an awful sickness pervading the Bitcoin space. Most Bitcoiners are normal, good people. For the vast majority of them, there’s no lifestyle associated with owning Bitcoin, as it should be. But there’s a subset of people — a small, flailing, shrinking group — who are mostly new to Bitcoin, made Bitcoin their entire personality, and became completely emotionally invested in it."

And continued:

"The moral basis of these people is cartoonish; it’s something that might appeal to a toddler. It’s a dreadful binary: every financial asset other than Bitcoin is a scam; every blockchain other than Bitcoin is a scam, and doomed to fail."

In Carter's view, the problem is clear: "Bitcoin Maximalism" is the culprit. His solution? Reject the ideology in its entirety.

**What is Bitcoin Maximalism?**

At issue in the drama is, of course, a deeper narrative about the cultural war ongoing in the cryptocurrency industry, one in which a group of its advocates are increasingly convinced that bitcoin, alone among cryptocurrencies, is the invention of the sector.

As Carter notes, the view of this group is that the broader cryptocurrency world is fraudulent, corrupt, an elaborate system propelled by greed in which new crypto assets are issued, pumped to insane prices, and sold to retail investors left holding a worthless bag.

The so-called "Bitcoin maximalists," in other words, reject the mainstream view that crypto assets are "the future of investing," or that they are a "new asset class."

It's an audience Carter has courted with his content, willfully or not, clarifying even in his critical post that bitcoin is "the only 'base layer asset I like" as an investment, a stance that has made him a maximalist favorite.

But in his quick effort to separate himself from the movement, Carter, unfortunately misses an opportunity to present it with any relevant critique. Most notably, there is the issue that Carter's essay spends its time objecting to behaviors easily related to any fanatic group that takes its aim at elites.

Is the problem with Bitcoin Maximalism itself? Or only a fringe group of adherents? Is the problem with the movement’s ideas? Or its expression of them? Unclear.

As such, Carter's argument inherently begins on uneven footing, his attempt akin to arguing for instance, that "the Democratic party needs to reject the woke left." Where does one end and the other begin? How does one continue to exist without the other? Why is this argument being made only now?

Still, in Carter's defense, there has been a lack of attempts to describe Bitcoin Maximalism, even those who subscribe to its tenets rejecting that it can be described.

It's a point on which I disagree.

Put simply, Bitcoin maximalists believe the following:

1. Bitcoin, a computer science invention, is the world's first working non-state monetary system. All other crypto assets compete with bitcoin by virtue of their existence, none offer long-term advantages without trade-offs.
2. Investing in other cryptocurrencies is [select one: wrong, stupid, immoral, uninteresting] and should be discouraged and ignored socially for the benefit of others as a form of consumer protection.
3. Bitcoin is only limited by human ingenuity. Anything other cryptocurrencies can do can otherwise be achieved by either bitcoin (or a centralized financial alternative).

Of course, you can argue against the above points, and Carter does so in his piece.

Most notably, he uses the piece to make clear he thinks the crypto market provides evidence of demand for alternative crypto assets, arguing that to "deny this is to deny reality." Which cryptos does Carter support and why? This again is unclear, as we're left only with the idea he does not think other blockchains are "useless."

"Just look at the data. There’s over $100 billion of stablecoins on other blockchains. They are objectively useful," he writes, adding: "They are used in real world transactions more than Bitcoin is."

Unaddressed again is that Bitcoin Maximalism, by nature, rejects the entirety of the crypto market and its data, and deems that there is [no value in its construction at all](https://archive.ph/wip/F0usl), being that it misrepresents, and indeed that it is incapable of adjudicating, issues of computer science.

As for stablecoins, faced with the prospect of migrating the old regime (government currencies) to the crypto world, it’s true some Bitcoin Maximalists oppose the scheme, viewing it a new vehicle for what they are trying to replace. Others, however, are attempting [to rebuild them on Bitcoin](https://lightning.engineering/posts/2022-4-5-taro-launch/), in line with their ideals. Far from proof the ideology “isn’t fixed,” as Carter claims, it’s an affirmation of it.

Still, while fine points on their own, worth debating in full, it's unfortunate they come amid a larger attempt by Carter to portray himself as more rational and data-based in his interpretations of the market.

Unfortunately, this view arguably misses the point of modern Bitcoin Maximalism, misconstruing it as a technical or economic argument, when in reality it is a cultural movement almost entirely.

**Why Does Bitcoin Maximalism Exist?**

Indeed, the biggest problem with Carter's critique is that in demonizing Bitcoin maximalists he fails to understand what the Bitcoin Maximalism movement has achieved – a defined worldview in which any investor supporting the competition is seen as the villain.

To understand why someone would support bitcoin only among cryptocurrencies, you have to understand that this person needs to reject the short-term incentive to do the opposite.

It's not exactly a secret – it's very easy to start a cryptocurrency, crypto hedge fund, or crypto startup and make millions overnight, with limited expertise. Virtually no crime in the sector is prosecuted. Virtually no failure is not heaped with massive reward. The recent collapse of Terra’s Luna[LUNA](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/luna-terra/) [-5.7%](https://www.forbes.com/digital-assets/assets/luna-terra/) stablecoin from “[blue chip crypto asset” to worthlessness](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/29/who-got-rich-before-terra-stablecoin-collapsed.html) is but the most prominent example.

The mansions of Puerto Rico are filled with legacy "cryptocurrency builders," who built nothing, lost investors money, and provided no valuable knowledge to the space.

In this environment, why would you choose to build or support the continued growth of Bitcoin? Develop or extend Bitcoin's technology? Or build a Bitcoin service or company? Especially when it's profitable to externalize failure to retail investors?

Moreover, why would you use bitcoin as money, when there are 30,000 other cryptos that may go boom or bust overnight, turning your dollars into millions for nothing?

Bitcoin Maximalism has an inherent and valuable answer to all these questions. It asserts that it is immoral to do these things and it exerts a social penalty of ostracism and ridicule on those who would put their own interest and welfare above Bitcoin.

As such, Carter is correct, it can and often does seem like Bitcoin maximalists are doing little more than applying an elaborate form of bullying to express their ideology.

As Carter puts it eloquently, maximalists assert "investing your time or effort anywhere other than Bitcoin is misallocation, malinvestment, grifting, or a scam."

He's also right here, but in failing to understand why the ideology adopts the stance, his text is left searching for boogeymen.

Time and again Carter's appeals to the idea that this stance can't be or isn't true, which again misses the point. To admit there is even one worthwhile crypto asset (though there may well be), is to undo the clarity of its moral structure, and the simplicity and accessibility of its message.

**Bitcoin Maximalism is Scaling**

Still, perhaps the most unfortunate characterization in the piece is the argument that Bitcoin Maximalism is a fringe, dying, or radical belief. To be clear, I identify as a maximalist and write for a Bitcoin-only company. This was not always the case.

I was and am a journalist. I wrote about many cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, like many Bitcoin Maximalists, I found the crypto market propelled by a system I could not support. Insiders got rich, retail got fleeced and a rogue's gallery of scammers remain at large. Efforts to police or self-regulate the industry have only ended up exacerbating this issue.

Bitcoin Maximalism exists as an antithesis to this culture and as a reaction to it, and in failing to take this into account, Carter's attempt to eulogize it only strengthens its case, his piece offering no proposal for assimilating the values of its offering. And, make no mistake, the offering is strong.

As evidence, one need only look at the culture's famous converts, [most recently Dave Portnoy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX8hbDL4CvQ), who admitted he’s "learned his lesson" not to invest in any other crypto asset after telling his audience outright to invest in a prior crypto Ponzi scheme.

If Portnoy doesn’t make clear the ideology’s everyman appeal, I’m not sure what will.

That's not to say, I don't foresee a future, as Carter does, where there might be alignment between the bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors, provided there is constructive work to unearth and align the underlying demands on either side.

Indeed, many of the specific technical arguments Carter makes, I’ve questioned as well, and can report, [they have documented answers and uncertainties worth discussion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2022/03/28/bitcoin-after-2140-differing-views-on-the-future-of-the-future-of-money/).

But bitcoin users, it's clear, want bitcoin to have a special recognition within the sector – it is the only decentralized cryptocurrency and it is one of few to have monetized from zero in a free and fair market issuance. Bitcoin maximalists may be clamoring for securities regulators to enforce that demand, but it can be enforced in other ways.

Bitcoin Maximalism also offers a way to safeguard retail investors from the obvious sham of the vast majority of the crypto market, encouraging them to hold their own money and to hold it in bitcoin, advice serving them well as the industry's stablecoins and institutional lenders collapse spectacularly.

Other than applying regulatory protections or advising retail investors to simply ignore the crypto sector in its entirety (which is what Bitcoin Maximalism does), what is Carter's solution to this issue? Again, his only appeal is to the strength of intellect – hardly a scalable solution, laudable as his own intellect is.

As I hope is clear, the intent of this essay is not to single out Carter in holding his view. For those sympathetic to the entrepreneurial spirit and who believe there are real problems bitcoin cannot solve, Bitcoin Maximalism can be an unfriendly worldview.

Yet, in attempting to overturn or subvert it, one must recognize what Bitcoin Maximalism offers, and that is, above all, an easy message of clarity and affirmation – that a monetary system that rewards savers is materially different from the Wall Street casinos, a culture that the crypto sector has only succeeded in co-opting.

In sum, Bitcoin Maximalism remains a strong and coherent cultural worldview, despite Carter's antagonism of it, and it will remain an accessible one – supported by [simplified storytelling](https://thelittlehodler.com/gallery/) and high-profile converts.

Unhappy with the powers that be? Withdraw your money from the financial system. Hold bitcoin. Want to right the inequities of the world? Build on the Bitcoin network, expand its access and offer a fair alternative that benefits all. Want to build a valuable business or company? Do it on Bitcoin and all users gain equally.

Sorry, in the face of a fly-by-night crypto industry whose only goal, it seems, is to recreate the worst of Wall Street, I'll take my chances with the Bitcoin maximalists upset by the status quo.

The space-time continuum converging on Bitcoin. PETE RIZZO VIA NASA FREE USE IMAGES

Bolstered by its [ascent on the world stage](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/28/business/ukraine-crypto-donations.html), not to mention the newfound admiration of [tech icons and investors](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/dealbook/web3-venture-capital-andreessen.html), it’s no secret Bitcoin believers are bullish on its future, with advocates going so far of late as to predict the global economy to be on the [verge of a cataclysm](https://twitter.com/1MarkMoss/status/1504178285315600390?s=20&t=o5k_AFLfXbOztLfp1OuZjg) only its invention can solve.

Still, if there is now an acknowledgement Bitcoin has carved a place in the economic order, discussions with the technology’s more tenured advocates reveal there remains a divergence in outlooks on its long-term development, divides that cut to the heart of the mysteries that remain in the decades-long experiment to create a digital cash.

But while no doubt natural in any emerging scientific field, the disconnects have arguably grown more pronounced with an influx of new investors into Bitcoin over 2021, many of whom are now more familiar with Bitcoin’s economics than its computer science breakthroughs, and who have been further emboldened by the escalating promises of its more eccentric advocates.

PROMOTED

Indeed, far from a technology trapped in competition, a growing number of today’s users see Bitcoin as a dominant predator on the economic landscape, an asset whose fixed policy and finite supply differentiate it absolutely not just from fiat monies, but all other cryptocurrencies.

Still, on the margins, Bitcoin’s more tenured evangelists appear to be quietly chafing at the fervor of the day, [arguing against a complacent culture](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/against-the-inevitability-of-bitcoin), [seeking to accelerate the pace of network upgrades](https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-dev@lists.linuxfoundation.org/msg10751.html), or else asserting that the project [could still fail](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget-ii-mm/).

The unspoken tension emerging can be summed up as such: At a time when Bitcoin advocates are eager to delight in the inadequacies of the global economy, its leading thinkers remain arguably as uncertain as to how its economy will mature as an alternative.

Promoting debate of late is that while Bitcoin is becoming mainstream as a portfolio asset, it remains a peer-to-peer network, the two attributes being irrevocably intertwined, each equally necessary for the system’s eventual operation.

Skip Ad

From here, thornier dilemmas begin to emerge – namely, if Bitcoin’s long-term viability as an asset is assured, why make improvements to its network at all? And conversely, what if our optimistic attitude toward its asset turns out to be a liability for the economics of its network?

To begin, the intent of this author is not to draw alarm, but to inform debate by parsing the prevailing opinions of those who today believe Bitcoin to be the only viable cryptocurrency, separating what the mainstream today sees as a homogeneous group.

Rather, this article will attempt to divide Bitcoin Maximalists into three broad camps – monetary maximalists, network maximalists, and platform maximalists – each of which holds a different bias toward its long-term direction.

In the paragraphs to follow, we’ll expand on these varied worldviews, illustrating how and why they appear to be subtly, but meaningfully, out of sync.

A Clash of Concepts

Embraced by all groups, of course, is the acknowledgement that Bitcoin is “decentralized,” a term that denotes how its money uniquely operates free from the control of any person or group. But we need only a brief survey of the crypto world to see there is [disagreement on the definition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2021/09/29/against-cryptocurrency-the-ethical-argument-for-bitcoin-maximalism/?sh=7d516f65371b).

Within Bitcoin there are notable divergences in its use as well, and it is here where the break between the sectarian groups of Bitcoin maximalists begins to become apparent.

Chiefly, while all variants believe strongly that Bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency, they differ as to the reasons why. Monetary maximalists, for instance, view all alternatives as inherently centralized, yet when asked, give answers that appeal to Bitcoin’s monetary policy.

Put succinctly, monetary maximalists seem to believe Bitcoin is decentralized because it has a finite supply and fixed monetary policy no one can change. If a cryptocurrency can change the rules that govern its asset or network, monetary maximalists argue the system is centralized.

Still, what appears obvious in this observation is that, in holding this view, monetary maximalists are introducing a definition of decentralization that is purely germane to the world of Bitcoin and not applicable to other computer science fields. Further, this obfuscates the fact that Bitcoin as a network can and does change parameters, [the most recent update](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-bitcoin-taproot-activation-is-exciting) coming last year.

Unsurprisingly, this is where the network maximalists clearly diverge. Composed mainly of more tenured developers brought up on the Bitcoin white paper and its cypherpunk vision, network maximalists harbor the same distaste for centralized cryptocurrencies as monetary maximalists, but stick more closely to definitions applicable to the internet and networking technologies.

Stated clearly, network maximalists believe Bitcoin is decentralized because the cost to censor transactions and change the rules is meaningfully high. Bitcoin may have value due to its asset properties, but these properties are protected by a network that’s always at risk of subversion.

Doubtless, there is much agreement between the groups on what contributes to Bitcoin’s value – including the [fair launch](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-distribution-was-fair-e2ef7bbbc892) by creator Satoshi Nakamoto, the [low cost of verifying transitions](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/measuring-decentralization/) with a node, and [the free market competition](https://assets.ctfassets.net/2d5q1td6cyxq/5mRjc9X5LTXFFihIlTt7QK/e7bcba47217b60423a01a357e036105e/BCEI_White_Paper.pdf) for new money issuance enabled by proof-of-work.

Yet, to the network maximalists and platform maximalists, decentralization needs to be evaluated, measured, and in the case of networks built on Bitcoin (like Lightning, Liquid, and sidechains), strategically limited to scale the network to handle larger volumes, add new features, and experiment.

Either way, the difference in attitudes should be obvious – one group sees decentralization as an absolute, while the others see it as a fragile, mutable state. This divergence accepted, we can move to the next question – namely, what is the attitude of each group toward Bitcoin’s long-term economics, security, and viability?

Network and Platform Maximalism

For network and platform maximalists, the answer has long been that the network’s security is tied to decentralization, which is protected by its [mining power](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696%23msg28696). Indeed, the idea that hash power equates to security is a long held belief, obvious in many [initial assessments](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-introduction-general-2-1330732717) of its design.

As these groups of maximalists are all too aware, in order to maintain its finite asset supply, the number of new bitcoins the network issues to miners must [trend toward zero over time](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3111/will-bitcoin-suffer-from-a-mining-tragedy-of-the-commons-when-mining-fees-drop-t/3129). As there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, one day Bitcoin will no longer distribute any new bitcoins.

Immediately, this appeared as if it should be a driving concern among Bitcoin believers, and so it was inferred that since miners protect the network, this “subsidy decline” [was a liability](https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/1109090592666062850?s=20&t=5JpkpLHqv-oYhIy_HHTHwQ), one that could only be solved as proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto, with [transaction fees](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/bitcoin-list/threads/6/) paid by users.

As such, the total fees paid by Bitcoin users has sometimes been termed a “[security budget](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget-ii-mm/),” the implication being that replacing new Bitcoin issuance with fees is essential to the network’s eventual operation. It so follows, network and platform maximalists are unified in foreseeing a future where fees for Bitcoin transactions may need to be both consistent and high.

Yet, cryptocurrency is anything but static, and shortly, a development would split the groups. Emerging in the mid-2010s, alternative cryptocurrencies would begin to launch, offering users new and experimental features, including some both camps assumed would be valuable for Bitcoin – like added privacy and the ability to create or represent new kinds of assets.

What would emerge in response was an ambitious thesis called [sidechains](https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf), a so-far unrealized effort that sought to wield Bitcoin’s network effects and user base in an effort to [assimilate new assets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ww2sh/brian_armstrong_on_twitter_ripple_stellar_and/) and blockchains, with the idea that Bitcoin could serve [as an ultimate platform](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/14/linkedin-co-founder-bitcoin-is-in-my-five-year-investment-plan/) for digital assets.

But while the network maximalists saw Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a platform as a more limited feature, meant to empower users with new freedoms and privacy, platform maximalists instead interpreted it as a mechanism to [engineer its economy](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2016/03/21/rootstock-raises-1-million-to-bring-smart-contracts-to-bitcoin/) at the expense of [alternative networks](https://twitter.com/_prestwich/status/1503098028919451649).

Indeed, what would become clear is that while network maximalists accepted Bitcoin’s inherent value over alternative networks, platform maximalists feared that Bitcoin was _competing against these networks for demand_ as a platform, a competition that, if lost, could lead to [its demise](http://gavinandresen.ninja/a-possible-btc-future).

But while less influential in Bitcoin of late, platform maximalism continues to dominate the crypto design ecosystem, [where leading cryptocurrency builders](https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I?reddit2) assert openly that demand (measured in fees) is what gives their competing cryptocurrency networks value and security as platforms.

This outlook defined, it’s clear platform maximalists accept a world where blockchains are just transaction platforms competing to: 1) Win demand 2) build fee volumes and 3) ensure the underlying incentives that power their respective networks. Network and monetary maximalists do not.

Monetary Maximalism

Yet, emboldened by a decade of demand for Bitcoin as an asset, monetary maximalists appear to be the most vocal in questioning the idea that the Bitcoin network is in any competition at all.

Increasingly the dominant form of Bitcoin maximalism, monetary maximalists believe Bitcoin’s asset has inherent value, and that its network [benefits from inherent demand](https://danhedl.medium.com/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8). Said another way, because Bitcoin is intrinsically valuable, settlement on its network is also intrinsically valuable.

In fact, monetary maximalists foresee a future wherein demand for Bitcoin increases to the point where paying for settlement on its blockchain is not optional. Rather, everyone will have to pay fees to move Bitcoin due to the fact it will be the most widely accepted global money.

Still, as outlined, this has important implications for Bitcoin’s development roadmap. After all, by holding this view, monetary maximalists are effectively rejecting the idea that top-level networks need to grow or boost Bitcoin’s demand beyond what is occurring for it naturally.

That this is true is evidenced by their primary critique against other cryptocurrencies, which in their effort to serve as platforms allow the creation of new money in the form of tokens – the very money printing monetary maximalists say Bitcoin solves. Far from a benefit, they assert this practice makes it impossible for these cryptocurrencies to ever garner any real demand.

Opposed to this alternative economic design, monetary maximalists are rejoicing at a time [when Bitcoin fees remain low](https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsSaving/status/1488715907249672193?s=20&t=7zC0oy237vuEsQEgVpz9mQ) and evoking a future where they might always remain low.

As Saifedean Ammous, author of _The Bitcoin Standard_, explained in a recent interview: “There’s no scenario where people are holding $1 trillion in Bitcoin and they can’t afford to pay to keep the network running.”

Even tenured developers, like Adam Back, cited in the Bitcoin white paper, have alluded they support this view. In a Twitter Spaces last year, he posited that users may simply pay to run the network because it is valuable, as they do the internet today.

Said differently, Ammous and Back evoke a future where Bitcoin is not secured absolutely – via some mechanism design that guarantees fees equivalent to today’s block rewards – but where Bitcoin is secured _by users_, who they say will always have the means to ensure its operation and overcome an attack.

Ammous goes so far as to suggest the value of the block reward – now $250,000 – may only be a kind of bootstrapping tool, necessary to protect the Bitcoin network in its infancy. By the time the subsidy runs out in 2140, [hyperbitcoinization](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/), he suggests, will have already occurred, a transition that will find global economic activity repriced in Bitcoin.

Summarized, far from an environment where the Bitcoin network remains at risk of attack, monetary maximalists see a future where humanity is destined to embrace and secure Bitcoin.

Conclusions

These positions described, we can assert that there are three important differences between the groups, first in [their bias to action](https://harappa.education/harappa-diaries/bias-for-action/) toward improving the network today, secondly in their attitudes to building on top of Bitcoin, and lastly in their confidence in its ultimate design security.

Indeed, it may be tempting to see the views of the differing maximalist groups as outlooks users can adopt freely to their advantage. Bitcoin has developed a [cyclical economy](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterizzo/2021/03/04/the-bitcoin-bubble-myth/), and so long as this monetization continues unabated, it may be decades before Bitcoin’s longevity is a concern.

Yet, the fact remains that, in following the monetary maximalists, Bitcoin is clearly charting a very different path than the one embraced by alternative cryptocurrency developers, who still see blockchain networks as having little value beyond their economic [utility as platforms](https://stark.mirror.xyz/q3OnsK7mvfGtTQ72nfoxLyEV5lfYOqUfJIoKBx7BG1I?reddit2).

For Bitcoin’s platform maximalists who still hold this view, the change in sentiment has been a shock, and of late, they have been forced to reckon with the idea they may now be a minority in the culture, working on solutions for problems that are no longer widely accepted.

It’s this author’s assertion that this is the likely cause of notable recent defections from Bitcoin, including the [ardent advocates](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/interview%253A-why-altcoins-are-not-a-threat-to-bitcoin-with-udi-wertheimer-2021-07-20) who of late have argued Bitcoin maximalism has “failed” due to the disinterest of users in competing or collaborating with alternative networks.

Still, it’s worth noting that all these groups soldier on, the network maximalists seeking ways to use Bitcoin [to build technology that expands user freedoms](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/canadian-trucker-protest-bypasses-restrictions-with-bitcoin), the platform maximalists promoting models that argue that [Bitcoin’s price appreciation](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/security-budget/) may not be enough to secure the network into the future, and the monetary maximalists focused on Bitcoin’s institutional adoption.

Of course, either way, it remains at best unclear how Bitcoin’s economics will evolve – while an interesting field of study, predicting the future 100 years out is difficult.

So why study the question at all? In his defense, this author would argue that, while clearly a historic invention, it remains to be seen if Bitcoin, as a technology designed and operated by humans, can remain truly free from our human flaws.

Ultimately, the real question posed by studying the variances may be bringing to light the biases at the core of each outlook – a bias to economic engineering (platform maximalism), a bias toward activism (network maximalism) and a bias toward economics (monetary maximalism).

Viewed through this lens, however, it’s hard not to see why the platform maximalism view has lately fallen out of favor. As opposed to a system defined by economic engineering, Bitcoin’s monetary maximalists appear at least united in believing that the Bitcoin economy may only ultimately persevere through our collective decision to value and protect it.
