What are governance tokens, and how do they work?

[https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-governance-tokens-and-how-do-they-work](https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-are-governance-tokens-and-how-do-they-work)

- Governance tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that allows tokenholders to vote on the direction of a blockchain project
- They aim to decentralize decision-making and give holders a say in how the project is run
- They are usually awarded to community members who have made significant contributions or demonstrated loyalty
- Tokenholders can use them to influence the direction and features of a blockchain protocol directly
- Some governance tokens only vote on a limited number of governance issues, while others vote on everything from development updates to smart contract revisions
- The primary function of governance tokens is still to distribute power
- Utility tokens, in contrast, do not carry any governance power and are used for a specific purpose
- Advantages of governance tokens include decentralization, incentivizing users to stay involved with the project, and more efficient development
- Risks and downsides of governance tokens include complexity, abuse, and centralization of power among a small group of tokenholders

**NFT Auction Process**

  

- The seller lists their NFT for auction on a blockchain marketplace, setting a reserve price (minimum price they're willing to accept for the NFT) and a starting bid.

  

- Potential buyers can place bids on the NFT using the cryptocurrency accepted by the marketplace. Each bid must exceed the previous bid by a minimum amount set by the seller.

  

- The auction continues until either the reserve price is met or the auction time limit runs out. If the reserve price is met, the highest bidder wins the auction and the NFT is transferred to their wallet. If the reserve price is not met, the auction ends without a winner.

  

- The blockchain marketplace collects a commission fee from the seller, usually a percentage of the final sale price.

  

- Some blockchain marketplaces also offer different auction formats, such as English auctions (where the price starts low and increases until no one else bids) or Dutch auctions (where the price starts high and decreases until someone bids). Additionally, some marketplaces may require bidders to hold a certain amount of the marketplace's own cryptocurrency to participate in an auction, as a way to promote liquidity and use of the platform's native token.

  

**How Long Do NFT Auctions Last? It Depends**

[https://postergrind.com/how-long-do-nft-auctions-last-it-depends/](https://postergrind.com/how-long-do-nft-auctions-last-it-depends/)

The article uses examples of NFT platforms such as Rarible and OpenSea and mentions auction houses such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s that have hosted NFT auctions for famous artists like Beeple. It also mentions different cryptocurrency blockchains like Ethereum, Polygon, Tezos, and Flow where NFT auctions take place.

  

- **English Auction:** In this type of auction, the auctioneer begins with a low starting price and gradually increases it until a bidder is willing to pay the highest price. Bidders openly compete against each other, with each subsequent bid being higher than the previous one. The auction ends when no higher bid is offered, and the last bidder wins the item. The duration of an English auction can range from a few minutes to several hours or even days, depending on the value of the item and the number of bidders.

  

- **Dutch Auction**: In a Dutch auction, the auctioneer starts with a high asking price and gradually lowers it until a bidder is willing to buy the item. The first bidder to accept the current price wins the auction. Dutch auctions are often used for selling multiple identical items, such as flowers or fish. The duration of a Dutch auction is usually short, ranging from a few minutes to an hour.

  

- **Sealed Bid Auction**: In a sealed bid auction, each bidder submits a single bid in secret, and the highest bidder wins the item. Bidders do not know what others have bid, and so they must bid their maximum price. The auction ends at a predetermined time, and the winning bidder is announced. Sealed bid auctions can be conducted in-person or online and typically last a few hours to a few days.

  

- **Vickrey Auction:** A Vickrey auction is a sealed bid auction, but the winner pays the second-highest bid, not their own bid. This type of auction encourages bidders to bid their true value for the item, as they will only pay slightly more than the next highest bidder. The duration of a Vickrey auction is similar to that of a sealed bid auction, lasting a few hours to a few days.

  

- **Reverse Auction**: In a reverse auction, the buyer sets a maximum price they are willing to pay, and sellers compete to offer the lowest price. The seller with the lowest price wins the auction and sells their product or service to the buyer. Reverse auctions can be conducted in-person or online and typically last a few hours to a few days.

  

**Promotion Platforms**

  

**Twitter** - Project accounts and developers.  Explaining design, interacting with community,  

  

**Discord** - Project communities. Servers, discussions, auxiliary content, access to exclusive contents. 

  

**YouTube -** Market Overviews and extended discussions. Listicles, podcasts, long and short-form videos.

  

**Controversies and Issues:**

  

- **Fake or plagiarized art:** One of the most high-profile scandals in the NFT world occurred in March 2021, when an artist named Beeple sold a digital artwork for $69 million at auction. However, it was later discovered that some of the images used in the artwork were plagiarized from other sources. This raised concerns about the authenticity and originality of NFT artwork, and whether it was being adequately vetted by marketplaces and collectors.

  

- **Environmental impact:** Another controversial aspect of NFTs is their environmental impact, as the energy consumption required for the proof-of-work mining process used by some blockchains can be significant. Some artists and activists have called for more sustainable alternatives to be developed, such as proof-of-stake blockchains or carbon-offsetting measures.

  

- **Money laundering and fraud**: Like any digital asset, NFTs can be used for illicit purposes, such as money laundering or fraud. In one recent example, a man was accused of using NFTs to launder more than $10 million in stolen cryptocurrency. Additionally, there have been cases of fake or counterfeit NFTs being sold on marketplaces, which can harm both buyers and legitimate sellers.

  

- **Legal disputes:** As the NFT market grows and becomes more mainstream, there are likely to be more legal disputes over ownership, copyright, and other issues. One notable case involved an NFT platform that was sued by a photographer who claimed that their work was being sold without permission or compensation.

  

- **Rug Pulls:** In NFT communities, a rug pull refers to a fraudulent act where the creators of a project suddenly exit with investors' funds, leaving them with worthless tokens. The term "rug pull" is borrowed from the world of decentralized finance (DeFi), where it describes a similar scam where liquidity providers are suddenly drained from a project, causing the value of tokens to collapse.

  

**The Biggest Rug Pulls in NFT History**

[https://nftnow.com/features/the-biggest-rug-pulls-in-nft-history/](https://nftnow.com/features/the-biggest-rug-pulls-in-nft-history/)

- Frosties Freeze: Frosties Freeze was a meme coin that was advertised as a charity token, with a portion of the proceeds going to polar bear conservation efforts. However, the project's developers disappeared after raising $1.5 million in ETH.

- Big Daddy Ape Club: Big Daddy Ape Club was a project that was launched in August 2021 and claimed to be a "multi-generational" NFT project. However, the project's creators pulled the rug and disappeared with over 4,000 ETH, leaving investors with worthless NFTs.

- Baller Ape Club: Baller Ape Club was a project that was launched in October 2021 and claimed to be a "next-gen" NFT project. However, the project's creators pulled the rug and disappeared with over 6,500 ETH, leaving investors with worthless NFTs.

- Evil Ape dupes: Evil Ape was a popular NFT project that was launched in September 2021. However, scammers created fake versions of the project and sold them to unsuspecting investors, resulting in losses of over $2 million.

  

  

**NFT minting**

  

**Using a specialized NFT platform:** There are various NFT platforms e.g OpenSea, Rarible, and Nifty Gateway. No coding or technical knowledge needed. You can upload your digital artwork, set the metadata, and mint your NFT with a few clicks.

  

**Using a smart contract on a blockchain**: You can mint NFTs by creating a smart contract that defines the NFT's attributes, metadata, and ownership. Ethereum is the most common blockchain for NFTs, and you can use Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum, to write your smart contract.Smart contracts can be programmed to mint and distribute NFTs automatically according to predefined rules.

  

**Using a NFT marketplace:** Some NFT marketplaces e.g Mintable allow you to mint NFTs directly from their platform by uploading your artwork and metadata. Once minted, you can list your NFT for sale on the marketplace.

  

**Hiring a developer:**IYou'll need to provide the developer with the artwork, metadata, and other details you want to include in your NFT.

Minting platforms: There are several NFT minting platforms available online that allow creators to easily create and sell their own NFTs. These platforms usually provide templates and tools that make it easy for creators to customize and mint their NFTs.

  

  

**Other Types of Minting**

  

**Generative art:** Generative art is a form of digital art that is created using algorithms. Creators can use generative art to create unique and one-of-a-kind NFTs that are different every time they are generated.

  

**Mint your own NFT at Art Basel Miami Beach**

[https://www.artbasel.com/stories/mint-your-own-nft-at-art-basel-miami-beach?lang=en](https://www.artbasel.com/stories/mint-your-own-nft-at-art-basel-miami-beach?lang=en)

  

The article mentions various art projects showcased in the "Humans + Machines: NFTs and the Ever-Evolving World of Art" exhibition at Art Basel Miami Beach, including:

  

- AI portraits by German artist Mario Klingemann, generated using an open-source blockchain called Tezos. Visitors can use Tezos to mint NFTs of their digital artworks.
- Strange AI-generated images of octopuses by Turkish digital artist and computer scientist Memo Akten, which contain fragments of encoded text forming a philosophical poem. These NFTs are minted using Tezos, which has a lower carbon footprint than other blockchain platforms.
- Generative art by Bulgarian artist Iskra Velitchkova, who creates ethereal images inspired by nature, and Australian artist Sutu, who creates sci-fi- and cyberculture-themed animations.
- Other artists featured in the exhibition include Matt DesLauriers, Helena Sarin, and Memo Akten.

  

The exhibition as a whole explores collaborations between humans and machines in the creation of art, and raises questions about the role of the artist in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

  

**Game assets:** Game developers can create NFTs for in-game items, characters, and other assets. These NFTs can then be sold or traded on NFT marketplaces.

Axie Infinity - Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game that uses NFTs to represent creatures called Axies. These creatures can be bought, sold, and traded on various NFT marketplaces, and players can use them to battle against other players.

  

Decentraland - Decentraland is a virtual world that uses NFTs to represent virtual real estate. Players can buy and sell virtual land on various NFT marketplaces, and can use it to build whatever they want in the game world.

  

The Sandbox - The Sandbox is another virtual world that uses NFTs to represent virtual real estate. Players can buy and sell virtual land on various NFT marketplaces, and can use it to build games, experiences, and other content in the game world.

  

Gods Unchained - Gods Unchained is a blockchain-based card game that uses NFTs to represent the game's cards. These cards can be bought, sold, and traded on various NFT marketplaces, and can be used to play the game against other players.

  

F1 Delta Time - F1 Delta Time is a blockchain-based racing game that uses NFTs to represent the game's cars and tracks. These NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded on various NFT marketplaces, and can be used to compete in races against other players.

  

  

**Royalties and royalties-sharing:** Creators can also create NFTs that represent shares of royalties or other types of revenue-sharing agreements. This can be a useful tool for creators to raise funds or for investors to support artists they believe in.

  

**Procedural generation:** This involves creating unique NFTs by using algorithms that produce random variations of a set of parameters or traits. In the case of Cryptokitties, each cat had a unique combination of traits, such as fur color, pattern, and eye shape, which were determined by a set of algorithms. The breeding process allowed for the creation of new cats with different combinations of these traits, resulting in a vast array of unique NFTs. The concept of procedural generation has since been used in other NFT projects, including Art Blocks and Bored Ape Yacht Club, to create unique and one-of-a-kind NFTs.

  

**Project Examples**

  

**Cryptokitties:** One of the earliest NFT projects that popularized the concept of NFTs being "born" through a minting process. 

  

**Art Blocks:** Art Blocks is an NFT project that allows artists to create generative art pieces using algorithmic processes. Each art piece is unique, and minted through a random seed provided by the buyer.

  

**Bored Ape Yacht Club:** Bored Ape Yacht Club is an NFT project that offers a collection of 10,000 unique digital ape NFTs. Each NFT is randomly generated and can have different attributes such as fur color, hats, and backgrounds.

  

**Loot:** Loot is an NFT project that offers a collection of 8,000 bags of randomized fantasy items. The items are not visualized, and instead, the project relies on the creativity of the community to come up with use cases and applications for the items.

  

**Pudgy Penguins:** Pudgy Penguins is an NFT project that offers a collection of 8,888 unique penguin NFTs. Each penguin has different attributes such as clothing, accessories, and backgrounds.

  

**World of Women:** World of Women is an NFT project that offers a collection of 10,000 unique female warrior NFTs. Each NFT has different attributes such as armor, weapons, and backgrounds.

**9 Genesis Land Plots**

9 Genesis Land NFTs in Axie Infinity sold for 1.5 million dollars. While it is the biggest NFT sale ever in terms of a single transaction, the price should be divided by nine since it is a nine Genesis plot. The purchase was interesting because it was made as a bundle of nine contiguous NFTs, meaning that the land is all together, rather than spread out. This makes it more valuable as a whole, and the fact that it sold for $1.5 million is notable, as it is the biggest NFT sale ever.

**CRYPTO PUNKS**

There are several reasons why the CryptoPunks NFT collection has been successful:

**Pioneering project:** The CryptoPunks were one of the first NFT projects on the Ethereum blockchain, launching in 2017. As a result, they have become a significant part of the history and culture of the NFT ecosystem.

**Rarity:** There are only 10,000 CryptoPunks in existence, making them rare and highly sought after.

**Unique design:** Each CryptoPunk has a unique design, with no two being exactly alike. This adds to their desirability and collectability.The Cryptopunk designs were created using a pixel art technique, with each punk being 24x24 pixels in size. The artwork was created by the developers of the project, Larva Labs, using a custom-built pixel art software.The Cryptopunks consist of a series of 10,000 unique characters, with each character having its own distinct features and traits. The characters are divided into different categories, such as male, female, alien, and zombie, and each category has its own set of traits.The traits include various attributes such as different hairstyles, hats, glasses, and accessories, as well as unique facial features such as beards, earrings, and scars. The combination of these traits creates a unique identity for each Cryptopunk character. The pixel art style gives the Cryptopunks a retro and nostalgic feel, reminiscent of classic 8-bit video games. This style has helped to make the collection stand out in the NFT world and has contributed to its success.

**Historical significance:** The CryptoPunks are seen as an important piece of digital art history, with their significance increasing as the NFT ecosystem continues to evolve.

**Cultural relevance:** The CryptoPunks have become a part of popular culture, with their images and designs appearing in music videos, memes, and other forms of media.

**High value sales:** The CryptoPunks have sold for extremely high prices, with some selling for millions of dollars. This has attracted a lot of attention to the collection and increased its perceived value.

- There are different types of NFTs such as PFP NFTs (profile picture NFTs), DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), and Gaming NFTs, which are becoming increasingly popular.

**Hash Mask number 6718** - sold for 300 ethers (equivalent to $603,012 in early 2021)

Hashmasks are a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that were launched in January 2021. Each Hashmask is a unique digital artwork created by a group of anonymous artists, and each one is represented by a different combination of a randomly generated color palette and a distinct set of features, such as eyes, mouth, and nose.

  

The Hashmasks collection consists of 16,384 individual NFTs, and each one is assigned a unique name and a number. The number assigned to each Hashmask is significant because it determines its place in the collection and its perceived rarity. The first Hashmask, for example, is number 0, while the last one is number 16,383.

  

The Hashmask NFTs were sold through a series of auctions on the OpenSea NFT marketplace, with prices starting at 0.1 Ether (ETH) and increasing based on demand. The sales were divided into several "epochs," with each epoch offering a different price and availability for the Hashmasks. The final epoch of the sale was concluded on February 11, 2021, with the last Hashmask selling for 420 ETH, which was worth approximately $650,000 at the time.

Jack Dorsey's first tweet NFT sale refers to a unique digital asset that was created by the founder and CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. In March 2021, Dorsey put up his first-ever tweet, which he posted on March 21, 2006, for sale as a non-fungible token (NFT) on a platform called "Valuables by Cent".
