**Control society (Deleuze)**

**Deleuze:**

**"In disciplinary societies, the individual passes from one closed environment to another: the family; the school; the barracks, the factory ... Now, societies of control, operating with computers, are replacing disciplinary societies ...**

**Enclosures are molds ... but controls are a modulation ... that continuously change... perpetual training replaces the school, and continuous control replaces the examination.**

**The numerical language of control is made of codes that [allow or disallow] access to information. We no longer deal with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," samples, data, markets, or "banks."**

**The operation of markets is now the instrument of social control ... short-term and rapid, but also continuous and without limit, while discipline was of long duration, infinite and discontinuous ..." (quoted from** [**http://ctheory.net//articles.aspx?id=567**](http://ctheory.net//articles.aspx?id=567)**)**

  

**We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become "dividuals," and masses, samples, data, markets, or "banks." Perhaps it is money that expresses the distinction between the two societies best, since discipline always referred back to minted money that locks gold in as numerical standard, while control relates to floating rates of exchange, modulated according to a rate established by a set of standard currencies.**

  

**Man is no longer man enclosed, but man in debt.**

DISNEYLAND

_Disneyland_

_exists in order to hide that it is the "real" country, all of "real" America that is Disneyland_

_(a bit like prisons are there to hide that it is the social in its entirety, in its banal_

_omnipresence, that is carceral). Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us_

_believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Angeles and the America that surrounds it_

_are no longer real, but belong to the hyperreal order and to the order of simulation. It is_

_no longer a question of a false representation of reality (ideology) but of concealing the_

_fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle._

  

_We situate our investigation in the context of a growing number of social critiques of_

_blockchain technologies, which predominantly focus on Bitcoin. Scott (__2015__) distinguishes_

_four types of such critiques. The first type criticises the libertarian ideology that_

_underlies the blockchain technology, by raising the argument that the individual_

_empowerment it enables does not trickle down to collective empowerment; that certain_

_forms of social injustice are still possible and perhaps even amplified by using_

_blockchain technologies (Golumbia_ _2015__). The second type focuses on the concern_

_that the already powerful strata of society benefit the most from the possibilities of the_

_blockchain, which amplifies political divides on the basis of gender, race, education_

_level. Bitcoin is therefore not the Bapolitical^ economical technology it is often_

_assumed to be (Kostakis and Giotitsas_ _2014__, p. 437). The third type focuses on the_

_claim that, even if the technology can be considered to be neutral, it still can be abused._

_For instance, it can be used for criminal activities, money laundering and blackmailing_

_(Ogunbadewa_ _2014__), and even (unintentionally) lead to a centralisation of power in the_

_hands of a small number of Bmining pools^ (Scott_ _2015__). The fourth type focuses on_

_the intrinsic power dynamics of the technology itself, on the way it mediates social_

_relations of people conducting transactions and setting up Bsmart contracts^. Rather_

_than rendering conventional governance fully obsolete, the blockchain introduces a_

_novel form, a new infrastructure of governance with its own power-dynamics_

_(Kavanagh and Miscione_ _2015__; DuPont_ _2014__). In these latter critiques, it is argued_

_that blockchain technologies have the capacity to transform our social reality._

Hype - based obfuscation - NFTs as representatives of an entire crypto space

  

**Major arguments in the Bitcoin section**

- Not fixing banking industry

- ‘Changing of the guard’ 
- Nothing outlined - what issues and what does it supposed to fix

- Energy and environmental impact
- Bad people like crypto
- Slow and unwieldy 
- “the hobby horse of a few hundred thousand gambling addicts.”

  

**Further arguments against Bitcoin**

- Not sustainable - disproportionately rewards early adopters
- Leads to serfdom as deflationary economics

  

**Not mentioned:** 

- Decentralization
- The state of money - gold standard, fiat standard

  

BUT mentioned in the interview

  

**Potential Lines of Argument**

- Bitcoin as protocol, language
- System broken long before 2008

- 1971, Fiat standard, 2008 not as a bug but as a feature
- In many ways Bitcoin evangelicals are not hyper-accelarationists but actually traditionalists - e.g saving etc

- Decentralized Finance, independent money, the unbankable

- ‘Rather than being a reprieve…” - what?

- Human factor - systems and structures affect incentives
- Is Bitcoin “hypercapitalist”?
- Relationship between trust and value
- Revolution - is Bitcoin revolutionary?
- Media Theory - technological determinism, narrative theory, control society
- The People Argument 
- Bitcoin Maximalism 
- Lifestyle

- Hypercapitialism and Transactionality
- Environmental 

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DidAwxWaDKI&ab_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DidAwxWaDKI&ab_channel=CoinBureau)

- Real world resource mining
- Single source - many stats disproven
- Comparative to what? - resource mining - banking industry
- Green energy - green industry
- Robust economic incentives
- Inflation -? No incentive to save

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCwLIE62iWg&ab_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCwLIE62iWg&ab_channel=CoinBureau)

- not having Bitcoin as net waste - Fiat inflation wasting more, concerns emerge during bull markets - sensationalism, qualitative evidence 
- Bitcoin is as clean as the energy you feed it, 
- Equipment efficiency improves

- Deflationary economics - serfdom 
- MLM
- Short-sighted
- Is this gonna solve problems? Are u even working on it?
- The predatory arm of the crypto movement
- Who knows how many big banks have a stake in crypto

What is our thesis?

1. Bitcoin is a net good 
2. Bitcoin should not be conflated with the rest of the cryptocurrency industry
3. The buzz around cryptocurrency obfuscates Bitcoin’s initial mission
4. Bitcoin has its issues but … 

  

AND What is our purpose?

- The tech isn’t going away, people need to be educated
- Markets exist

  

Notes + Questions

- How do we feel about Ethereum?
- The internet was literally created by the military, like talk about ‘governance’ 
- Bitcoin codependency

  

Questions for Karl 

- Ecosystem - who’s active? Loud voices in Bitcoin?
- Incentive structures - what are system incentives in trad fin vs btc
- Control mechs - what is the difference between techno structures

To summarize the disputes outlined in this video:

  

- Dan says that the lofty goals of bitcoin were never realized, in large part because no one uses it as currency because its mechanics expressly disincentivize doing so. Austin claims that this is wrong because large institutions are, to paraphrase, "taking bitcoin seriously now." Austin also points out that solutions do now exist to make bitcoin transactions faster.

  

- Austin conflates Dan's skepticism of the white-nationalist-adjacent 'sound money' proponents of bitcoin with him saying that "if you like cryptocurrency then you're racist." He asserts that crypto ventures claiming to help people in poorer areas of the world, what Dan labels as 'astroturfing' in his piece, are not so, but provides no sources, examples, or arguments beyond the simple refutation.

  

- Dan criticizes the structural incentives baked into proof-of-work that disproportionately reward those with existing capital. Austin concedes this point but claims that it isn't actually bad on the basis that all competitive businesses operate this way. Any genuine engagement with Dan's capital-critical perspective is brushed off out of hand.

  

- Austin claims that bitcoin's power use is unduly criticized when it is the case that all web technologies use a considerable amount of power at scale (YouTube, Netflix, etc.). The fact that these technologies provide vastly different services is not addressed. Austin also takes issue with Dan's comparison of the power usage in a single bitcoin transaction vs. a single VISA transaction, claiming that Dan should have taken into account all of the power necessary to keep all of the businesses party to that transaction running for the amount of time that said transaction is pending.

  

- And the largest part of the video: Austin takes issue with Dan being occasionally meanspirited in the phrasing of his criticisms of specific people ... while also self-admittedly "stooping to Dan's level" and partaking in the exact thing he criticizes Dan for.

  

Also, I can't help but reel at the sheer misunderstanding of Dan's work that Austin demonstrates in his conclusion: "Olson's persistent argument is that because there are scammers in the space then the whole thing is a scam." Like ... no. No it's not. That is very clearly not the argument being made and the fact that Austin chose to summarize it in that way makes me question just how much he was paying attention to Dan's video.
