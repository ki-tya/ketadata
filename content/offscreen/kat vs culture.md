**Kat vs. Culture: Chapter 1**

Alright, cards on the table: as of now, I have been living in Amsterdam for less than two months. Did I do any research on Dutch mentality before my arrival? Not a single google search. Should I be making sweeping generalizations about the Dutch populace? No, probably not. Is that going to stop me? Not at all.

  

 _“It's weird not to be weird.”_

― John Lennon

**Part I: Baby, you’ve got a big storm comin’**

“Why do you all think I’m crazy?”

It was a blunt question, without a hint of irony. I tend to approach such topics more delicately, but at that moment in time I hadn’t slept in 32 hours and the Red Bull, while not quite delivering on its promise of wings, did give me a certain reckless abandon.

“Well, you see…” somebody started answering.

I froze. I was expecting reassurance: some good-natured ‘no, we don’t think you’re crazy’, or a polite pretense of incomprehension. Little did I know, I was about to be led into the belly of the Dutch cultural beast, a place from which I would not return unscathed.

  
“We have this saying,” they continued. “It roughly translates to ‘just be normal, that’s already crazy enough’, that’s kinda the Dutch mentality.”

  

The words echoed in my head.

  

This cannot be real, there is no way this is real, this must be a joke, the pot leaf is the literal emblem of the city, for god’s sake. But suddenly, it all made grotesque sense. All the confused looks, the scandalized exclamations, the raised eyebrows, the feigned giggles and the condescending nods.

  

They all made sense.

**Part II: For the sake of Context**

  

In order to understand my shock, I think it is important to make clear the expectations I had before moving. Here are a few things I thought Amsterdam would be comparable to:

  

1. ‘That 70’s Show’ but without the parent characters
2. New-Age Portland, Oregon with more self-awareness and less home-grown kombucha
3. The backstage dressing room of a family-friendly Drag Club

  

I started realizing that Amsterdam was less ‘Sex ’n’ Drugs ’n’ Rock ’n’ Roll and more ‘Work ’n’ Housing Crisis ‘n’ Alcohol’ pretty early on. But on that Wednesday afternoon, all my remaining illusions were irreversibly shattered.

**Part III: A spoonful of Buddhism** 

  

Still reeling from this revelation, I wasn’t gonna go down without a fight. The mind can go to great lengths in order to fit something into its ideological framework and I, as a self-proclaimed open-minded individual, was set on looking past the superficial implications of conformity to find the core of pure philosophical genius in this Dutch proverb.

_“Just be normal, that’s already crazy enough”_

Interpretation 1 - The Absurd Nature of Existence

We are four-limbed creatures that have come into being through ages of evolutionary processes on a flaming rock in outer space. Everything about our existence is crazy. Therefore, the concept of normal is essentially paradoxical, which is the philosophical crux on which this saying rests.

Interpretation 2 - The Hyper-Individualistic Hot Take

We are all unique individuals. Therefore, trying to be unique or ‘different’ is misguided and pointless. So if we take the phrase ‘be normal’ and equate it to ‘be yourself’, then the saying acts as a flag under which all outcasts, underdogs and freaks can unite…in theory. 

​

Interpretation 3 - The Middle Path

The word ‘enough’ brings up two main associations in my head. Firstly, there is of course the communist angle, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs”. However, due to my post-soviet roots, I try not to dwell on Communist overtures… just a personal preference. 

Secondly, there is the Buddhist idea of the ‘Middle Path’, a way to liberate oneself by existing in the golden center between self-indulgence and self-denial. This interpretation was my favorite. It allowed me to think of The Netherlands as an enlightened mecca, a Western society that transcended Western philosophy while retaining

its civilized and progressive values. I was content, I cracked the code. 

Alas, every Dutch person that I have spoken to about this instantly rejected all three interpretations and instead led me further down the dizzying rabbit hole of ‘classic Dutch sayings’ which I have compiled for you below.

  

_Tall trees catch a lot of wind._ 

  

_He who is born a dime will never be a quarter._ 

  

_Don’t stick your head above the mowing lawn (or else it will get cut off)_

  

_Normalcy is the glue between me and you._ 

  

_Be Normal or Be Gone._ 

_(_apparently used as a slogan by a previous Prime Minister)

​

  

**Part IV: Weird Flex but OK**

  

In fairness, I must clarify that this normalcy craze is not oppressive. There are no gulags for weirdos, which is lucky because I’d be far gone by now. It is not something explicitly stated or enforced. Some foreigners don’t even notice this particular affinity for ‘blending in’ and carry on as they usually would. Others, i.e. me, have a hard time pinpointing the reason why we( i.e. I) feel more like Winona Rider in _Girl, Interrupted_ with every passing day. The people I’ve met are Tolerant™, just quite perplexed by my general character.

  

But what is normal? I wanted some specifics. So I did some research. 

  

Apparently ‘being normal’ precludes:

- bragging
- showing off or acting pretentious
- discussing money (or how much you have or make)
- showing a little too much personality
- showing overt public displays of emotion
- not following the ever-important unwritten rules and regulations of the Lowlands (what?)
- acting or being perceived as too “weird”, “different”, “disobedient” or “foreign”

So there you have it.. the unofficial rules of engagement, laid out in all their mild-mannered glory. 

**Part V: A tiny violin and a bit of self-reflection**

  

Alright so perhaps I was spoon-fed performative individualism as a way of life for as long as I can remember. And yes, I have spent years fighting off insecurities in order to finally embrace my eccentricities. And yes, Amsterdam makes me feel a little bit like a wayward mental patient for it. But I’ll bite. I can understand how these unspoken rules may benefit society….I guess… There is a certain calmness to it. There is a safety to it. Either way, it’s a fascinating case study, one that I did not expect to stumble upon. And one that I fully intend to investigate further.

**Kat vs. Culture: Chapter 2**

_“To live is to war with trolls.”_

                              - Henrik Ibsen

It’s the most wonderful time of the year, and I’m taking you along a little detour to fully experience it. Never has Christmas spirit felt so counterintuitive and never has a dead horse been beaten with such grace.

 **Part VI: The Blacker the Pete, the Hotter the Take**

I found out about the Zwarte Piet tradition on a chilly September morning. Our small group of smokers wasn’t too talkative that day, but we did not know each other well enough at that point to comfortably stand in silence. A girl, who would later become my friend, asked me if I knew about ‘the whole blackface drama’. I didn’t. She pulled up a picture.

It took me a second to realize what I was looking at. The image looked surreal. The beaming blackfaces dressed in old-timey garb. It must have been taken before the racial debates sparked because there was an obliviousness to it that compounded the entire spectacle. It was like staring at a page in a history textbook, an image that was far better suited for a satirical cartoonist’s rendering than full digital color.

I looked up, somewhat overplaying my shock. She laughed, clearly enjoying my reaction.

“We used to dress up as Zwarte Piet all the time,” she said. “Nobody thought it was racist.”

Since then I have heard similar accounts. The story goes: everybody thought it was normal, then the wave of social justice hit a few years back, and ever since then it’s been a contentious topic. As with any hot button issue, the discourse has become impassioned, sprouting protests and drawing a definitive line in the sand.

Here’s the thing: I’m an American. I’ve had a sense of white guilt since elementary school. When I see blackface, I shudder. As such, it is easy for me to label the entire thing disgustingly racist. And it is. But what I find far more disconcerting is the insistence on the fact that nobody knew it was wrong. From what I’ve gathered Zwarte Piet is canonically, at least in some versions, Saint Nicholas’ ‘helper’, as in his…slave.  This level of denial speaks to a deep cultural insulation in a society that has an international reputation for its ‘progressive values’. It reveals a traditionalism, or rather an imperialism, that is still deeply and brazenly embedded within the core of this country. I was shook.

But I am not surprised that people are having a hard time letting go of Black Pete. If somebody told me tomorrow that the Easter Bunny was being banned, I would throw a hissy fit.

I am far more surprised by those on the other side of the issue. Those liberal sweeties who have now become born-again crusaders for justice. They talk about the entire thing as if it is ludicrous, despite having partaken in the tradition their entire lives. It has become natural for them to sneer at the other side, retroactively absolving themselves from any past wrongdoing. The entire discourse has followed the evolution of all similar farces. It has become a showdown between those unwilling to move with the times and those who enjoy feeding their ego with a sense of self-righteousness. I’m also surprised it’s not an international scandal. Somehow this country’s critical mass of tulips is a more recognizable characteristic than the fact that about 1 in 5 of its citizens habitually celebrate Christmas by putting on a minstrel show.

At the end of the day, Zwarte Piet has to be retired. There is no question about it. The apple has been bitten, there is no more blissful ignorance left to claim. It will never be pure again, not that it ever was. Those who are trying to salvage the tradition are fighting a futile battle against a shameful history of brutalization. The tradition has lost all of its coziness and joined the ranks of ‘political statements’. But everyone knows that. It comes down to the fact that people just want to yell at each other sometimes, and this controversy has given them the perfect opportunity to do so. And they’re just not quite bored of it yet. 

 **Part VII: A Penny for your Thoughts & a Dime for your Silence**

I thought it would be easy to transition from racial politics to something more lighthearted, but it has proven to be somewhat of a dilemma.

When I moved to Amsterdam I did not envision myself commenting on social issues. I envisioned myself smoking fat blunts and listening to vaporwave. The difference between outside perception of this city and its internal conservatism has become a point of fascination for me. The Amsterdam that people talk about, the haven of drugs and prostitutes, does exist. It just exists in a different dimension of time and space, like Las Vegas. But this imaginary sin city can only exist in the minds of those who do not reside there. The dealer might always win at BlackJack, but the player is the only one having fun.

As a tourist destination, Amsterdam fulfills its role, it delivers on its promises. Yet, it was naive of me to think that this would extend to daily life. The infrastructure that holds up the entire tourist market has been created by incredibly sober people, and that is why it hasn’t collapsed yet. Vegas would be a mess if all its residents got drunkenly married every weekend at the Elvis chapel and Amsterdam would mutate into a monster of a different kind if it was 4/20 24/7.

The truth is you can’t have your cake and eat it too. Tourists live out their fantasies and the Dutch begrudgingly allow them to do so. It is an unspoken agreement of non-interference. ‘Amsterdam’ is a city just like any other but it is also an idea of itself. Like all other symbols, it exists in the eye of the beholder. The fantasy can exist until you start searching for the reality. It is the reverse of Wonderland, the rabbit hole takes you down into a civil society whilst the tea parties and mad hatters are all left on the surface. It’s quite a neat trick, if you think about it.

**Kat vs. Culture: _Chapter 3_**

_“Originality is independence, not rebellion; it is sincerity, not antagonism.”_

- George Henry Lewes

​

**Part VIII: Suffering and the City**

In his lectures on ‘love’, Alain de Botton, often comes back to the same idea. This idea is that people dismiss partners who are compatible and good for them. Rather, they are attracted to people who will make them suffer in familiar ways. This ‘familiar suffering’ is traced back to childhood, just like pretty much everything in psychology. Socialization, parental modeling and even early childhood trauma are factors in the development of this concept of familiar suffering that is so often sought out in partners. Botton’s claim is that this psychological malfunction has been romanticized and rebranded as ‘the spark’, much to the detriment of healthy relationships. Perfectly good partners are often written off as ‘boring’ because of their lack of pain-inducing potential.

You might be asking yourself why I have given you this spiel. Well, my theory is that the same thing applies to cities. Think of New York and how its image has been emblazoned on the collective conscious as ‘the place to be’. Think of Carrie Bradshaw in the first minutes of the ‘Sex and the City’ pilot describing her undying devotion to New York. All those skyscrapers, all that vigor. Of course, there is also Paris, the city of love. Think of that Eiffel Tower and those beautiful bridges, think of the Champs-Élysees and the Opera House. Isn’t it just so appealing to be a New Yorker or a Parisian?

But here’s the truth of the matter. New York is a city that sucks people dry. It doesn’t matter how much you’re doing, you could always be doing more. The skyscrapers are held together by the pure stress and frustration that accumulates in the air. People have to walk to the center of Central Park for the luxury of a quiet moment.

Paris isn’t much better, it’s one of the grittiest and grimiest cities in the world. Take a single wrong turn and you are no longer a wandering romantic, you are hunted prey. Parisians are the most cynical people I have ever met, and also, let’s face it, the only reason you think the Eiffel Tower is romantic is that it's been systematically rammed down your throat. It’s a post-apocalyptic structure that just happens to sell a lot of keychains. Fight me.

So, where does that leave Amsterdam? For me, Amsterdam is completely devoid of ‘spark’. It does not make me suffer in the way that Moscow, Miami, or London did. Actually, it barely makes me suffer at all, and I hate it for that. I am not emotionally mature enough to enter into such a grown-up relationship with the city I live in. Yes, New York and Paris are balls of pure tension. But oh boy, if that doesn’t sound like an adventure that I would fully volunteer for.

However, I implore you not to follow my example. I commend everyone that didn’t start smoking just to piss off their parents and in that same way I commend those who have formed a healthy and sustainable relationship with Amsterdam. 

This is not my hit piece. This is the love letter that I am still too immature and angsty to write.

 **Part IX: The Directness Dilemma**

I often hear people talk about how refreshingly direct Dutch people are. And it’s true. I’ve gotta give it to ya. Y’all really do say it outright, no filter. And more than that, there seems to be a level of judgement towards those who are less direct and perhaps a bit more performative in the way they present themselves. Why be coquettish and flirty when you can just ask the stranger dancing next to you if they wanna take you home tonight. But there is something that is lost through this outright expression of physical desire, a yearning and vulnerability which is never allowed to sublimate itself through hints and concealed gestures. The Dutch Directness calls for a nudist representation of the individual while simultaneously repressing overt expression of emotions and peculiarities. It calls for flesh colored-suits that simulate the experience of authenticity yet hide all that is truly raw. Performativity is seen as fake, on par with outright lying. Yet is it not the performance of directness in which the Dutch are ensnared. The pernicious idea that everything can be said as it is leaves no room for the acknowledgment of the truly unspeakable. 

There is a game afoot, it’s just too simple. Which makes it awfully difficult to enjoy.

**Part X: Brief Encounters of the Pointless Kind**

**​**

**_Scene 1. Bus stop. Around 2 AM._**

My hands were frozen solid but that did not stop me from forcing them to roll me a cigarette. I still had 12 more minutes until my night bus came. I’d need my nicotine.

I licked down the paper, with great strain I had managed to craft something resembling the long lost and partially deformed sibling of a Marlboro and started trying to light it in spite of the gusts of wind hitting me from every which way.

Out of the corner of my eye, behind the disappointing sparks of my leopard print lighter, I noticed a scraggly man on a bike stopping in front of me. I turned around ready for a late night confrontation but he just looked over and did the universally accepted hand gesture for  ‘give me a cigarette’. I started explaining that it would take me time to roll it and that I actually would rather not, but he just stared at me with a glazed, desperate sheen over his eyes.

Maybe sympathy took hold, maybe I still had 10 minutes to wait and I decided it was warmer to be distracted; I started rolling him a cigarette.

Looking over at me as I begrudgingly searched for my filters, he decided to fill the silence.

“Do you smoke coke” he asked in a tone that sounded more like a survey than a proposition.

“Do you mean crack?” I asked. 

“Yeah, crack. Do you smoke crack?”

“No.”

“Good for you,” he tracked off, turning away from the streetlight.

Short pause.

“You know,” he said, snapping his head back towards me, “it’s bad to smoke coke, don’t do it, before I started I was in such good shape, I was really so serious, I cared so much.”

There was a long pause. I tried to support this self-disclosure with an understanding nod.

He took a deep breath and shook his head.

“But I fucking love coke! It’s the best thing I ever tried. Weed? You smoke weed? Weed was NEVER for me, but smoking coke, smoking crack, sorry.” 

He put his palms up in an apologetic shrug.

“That's what I love, I’m gonna get home, it’s gonna be so good!”

I licked the edge of the paper and pressed it down.

“Here you go, enjoy.”

I handed him my thoroughly limp creation.

“Oh, I will,” he replied with the confidence of a made man as he shakily got back on his bike and jangled on into the night.

**_Scene 2. Albert Heijn. Around 9 PM._**

I dragged my feet down the medicine aisle. The common cold has never felt more deadly. Nose running, eyes tearing up. Not looking my best, let’s put it that way. 

Looking through the cough medicine on offer, I started kneeling down like a feral animal to examine every flavor. Did I want cherry? Did I want classic? Oh to be blessed with so many choices!

From the outside, I imagine this decision-making process looked something akin to an interpretive dance set in the times of cholera.

As my arm extended out like a Tim Burton tree towards the paracetamol, I noticed a respectable-looking middle aged woman coming up next to me. Now, contrary to popular belief, I might act like a savage sometimes but I am mostly civil as far as daily life goes so, in accordance with common courtesy, I straightened out, not wanting to nudge her in the midst of my fever-induced frenzy.

She stopped her cart and  looked over at me, assessing my pitiful appearance. Then, without missing a beat, she let out a sigh and said something in Dutch.

“Sorry, english,” I replied weakly through my sniffling.

“Oh,” she gave me an encouraging smile. “I said – the purple one is the most accurate.”

At this point, I was very confused. I didn’t know if she was just a new age enthusiast repeating what she read in a self-help book or a psychic offering to share some insight about my ultimate demise.

I stood there looking at her, a little bit paralyzed, not sure how to tie a nice bow to finish off this strange interaction. She wasn’t looking at me, her eyes were placed firmly on the pharmaceuticals. I slowly followed her gaze through the shelves and down to the pregnancy test section.

Oh she thinks that’s what I’m here for…

That’s kinda funny.

I began mulling over my options, thinking of the quickest way to explain that my eyes are not watering at the prospect of child-bearing but that it was, in fact, chain smoking on my balcony which had done me in. But, alas, there seemed to be no viable option.

I decided to keep it casual.

“Yeah, maybe next time.” I reached down to get the lemon Coldrex.

“But thank you.”

​

**_Scene 3. Cafe The Minds. Around midnight._**

“What is this place,” I asked, kicking open the door like Dorothy fresh off the tornado.

The two burly men playing pool looked up but didn’t say anything. Finally, a man decked out like a Hell’s Angels drag impersonator slowly turned around on his barstool.

“This,” he said in a surprisingly soft voice “is the last anarchist bar in Amsterdam”.

I tucked a strand of bright orange wig hair behind my ear and looked over at my friend. She, in turn, gave me a drunken nod to indicate her absolute neutrality.

“Well then, sounds like the place to be.”

We walked in and plopped our things down on two barstools at the far side of the room. The Stone Roses were quietly playing on the stereo. My friend, slightly slurring her words, told me to order drinks while she went to the bathroom. I smacked my gum in compliance.

The bartender was a tattooed man in his forties or fifties who seemed to be  purposefully avoiding eye contact with me. His head was shaved except for a small square right above the center of his forehead which was half-heartedly spiked up. I respected the style, it gave him all the symbolic convictions without the necessity for any tedious upkeep.

I leaned over across the bar and gave him the cheesiest smile I could muster. He raised an eyebrow, almost surprised that I had enough courage to ask him for something.

“Hi, can I please have two ciders?”

He rolled his eyes. “We don’t sell cider,” he growled back.

“Ok, then we’ll have two glasses of red wine, oh and can I pay by card?” I asked innocently, pretending not to notice his agitation.  

He sharply exhaled through his nose, which I thought was a nice dramatic touch.

“No, we don’t take cards,” he pointed above a stack of glasses. “There’s a big fucking sign right there that says NO CARDS.”

“Okay, okay, Jesus, I got it”

He turned around in a huff and I sat back down quietly, not wanting to annoy the sole bartender of the last anarchist bar any further than I already had.

The man that I originally spoke to came up next to me.

“Don’t let Walter intimidate you, he’s a nice guy but he doesn’t like me either sometimes.”

I turned around to face him, he had warm eyes and a grey beard, like a cross between my grandfather and a wise raccoon.

“Really? Why doesn’t he like you?”

He leaned in. “Well, every time I’m here, I ask him to put on The Carpenters, you know The Carpenters?”

“Yeah, of course, Karen Carpenter,” I replied, pulling at the fine strings of my pop culture knowledge. “How could I not, she’s a legend.”

He looked kinda proud of me. It kinda made me want to cry.

“Yes, yes, that’s right, Karen Carpenter.”

Walter came back with his signature disapproving look and set two glasses of red wine down in front of me.

“Walter,” I squeaked in the most joyfully American accent you can imagine.

“Why don’t you want to put on The Carpenters?”

His eyes softened and he gave me a very restrained grin.

“I’d put them on, I have no problem with them,” he started out defensively. “We just don’t have any Carpenters.”

“So you’re telling me that if I brought you the CD, you’d put them on?”

“No.”

**Part XI: The Village of Embassies**

Along a winding road, amidst scraggly trees, the embassy houses stand quietly guarded by thick metal gates. There is no sign of nationalistic grandeur, each building looks equally as respectable as the next, all in a striking tone of modest, cream-colored bourgeoisie comfort – neighborly yet detached. Looking into the windows, I could hardly imagine these rooms as official extensions of international governance. The homeliness of the whole setup kept me confused, it was the perfect place for jogs and strolls and barbecues and raising kids. A domestic bliss for bureaucrats and diplomats.

This was the first time ‘Dutch hospitality’ seemed like an apt way to describe something. I’ve heard the expression bounced around, yet in comparison to the iconography of ‘southern hospitality’ with their grits and drawls and memory quilts, it always seemed to come up short. But not in this little village of nations, each country-house was as welcoming as a great Aunt Martha who married a doctor, had three children and, after sending them all off to college, retired peacefully to some renovated ranch. She asks about your plans for the future and you never know quite what to tell her. It’s a calm and structured hospitality, the kind that blossoms from social and business contracts, the respectable kinds of obligations.

This small alternate dimension nestled somewhere in the Hague has all the dramatic effect of a chess game between two equally middle-tier opponents, played out on a thick wooden table in a spacious living room. It is pragmatic and banal, nostalgic and stout. All the things that you wish your parents were but you desperately don’t want to become.

**Part XII: Kings and Queens and Buenos Aires**

Portraits of the Dutch royal family look like promotional posters for a daytime soap opera. Just one look at their beaming faces and the episodes start writing themselves.

Scene one: His Majesty Willem-Alexander helps Catharina-Amalia with her homework.

Scene two: Princess Ariane finds a puppy on the street and sneaks it into the palace.

Scene three: Queen Maxima starts working on her self-help cookbook ‘Maxima’s Guide to Family and Filet Mignon’ but encounters a bout of writer’s block.

Each episode would end with a wholesome moral message: the class will be passed through determination, the puppy will become part of the family, and inspiration will be found in an unexpected encounter with an old friend.

However, after three more clicks through Wikipedia, I was surprised to discover that there was a lot more to this Dutch made-for-tv series. Willem-Alexander, who is ‘actively involved in water management’, first introduced himself to Maxima as simply ‘Alexander’ so that she wouldn’t know that he was a prince. If that’s not an opener for a 2000’s romantic comedy with a soundtrack exclusively featuring the Plain White T’s and Colbie Caillat, then I don’t know what is. But we go on. Queen Maxima, who is first described as ‘an economics major’, is Argentinian. The divide between European and Latin American political structures generated enough controversy to prevent her father from coming to the wedding, which is really just a roundabout way of saying that her family has reaped the benefits of a dictatorship the likes of which is almost unimaginable, and unsightly, in the context of the Netherlands.

But there is something far more fascinating to me than a little political fuss. After clicking on Queen Maxima in hopes of finding out information that would elevate her to the dramatic equivalent of Madonna’s Evita, I found out that she is far more nuanced than I would’ve ever guessed. Under the section title ‘Controversy over statement on Dutch identity’, her 2007 quote reads as follows:

... but 'the' Dutch identity? No, I have not found it. The Netherlands is: large windows without curtains so everyone can look in; but also adherence to privacy and coziness. The Netherlands is: one biscuit at tea; but also great hospitality and warmth. The Netherlands is: sobriety, control and pragmatism; But also the experience of intense emotions together. The Netherlands is far too diverse to summarize in one cliché. 'The' Dutchman' does not exist. As a consolation I can tell you that 'the' Argentinian also does not exist.

I imagine that  from the perspective of a European Royal Family, that is a radical thing to say. It is eloquent and incisive and self-aware. It shows the capacity to love and critique simultaneously, and perhaps I am starting to go a little soft but that has gotta be the most comforting and regal quality in a monarch that I have ever encountered.

**Part XIII: Carpe Diemen**

“So my friends told me to invite this girl from tinder to a ‘Pimps and Hoes’ themed party. And we get there and I don’t know what’s going on. One of the strippers put a banana in her [gestures towards crotch area and widens eyes] vagina, and she just… shot it out of there. I’m from Diemen, I don’t know what to do in a situation like that.  Look and I have a video, but not of the banana, but she catches her underwear in her mouth. Look, isn’t that cool?”

**Kat vs. Culture: _Chapter 6_**

_Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live, even though they die; and whoever lives by believing in me will never die. Do you believe this?”_

**Part XIV: Springcore**

Illuminated by the cautious April sun, Amsterdam emerges as a city overcome with whimsy, a delicate pastiche of associations. The cyclists, with their newly straightened backs, are no longer objects of rain-soaked pity. In a sunnier landscape, they become an aspirational symbol of laidback pragmatism, a restrained yet seductively slender group of hybrid machinery, a spiritual community complete with their own looks and customs. The parks, which for the past 3 months have been little more than unsightly heaps of shrubbery, have a restored sense of vitality. Their raison d’étre once again sweetly apparent in each blooming tree reflected in every dog walker’s eyes. Even the bricks, adorned with fresh graffiti paint, seem to breathe in the sprightly air every once in a while.  

It is all in this Medieval village of a modern city. Small boats, tied at the side, gently wobbling along with the rhythm of the canals, overlooked by firmly parked Renaults. The former beckoning to reverse time and surrender to the everyday bustle of routine as it is witnessed in Bruegel’s oil paintings, promising all the joys of simplicity which can be discovered from a birds-eye view. The latter: a cynical reminder of the state of affairs, a fantasy so crudely dispelled within its own frame.

This is the Billy Joel rendition of _‘What a Wonderful World’_, Armstrong’s husk replaced with a crystal clear tenor. It underscores everything from the middle-aged woman in chunky heel boots gardening tiny plots of greenery in front of her picture perfect house to the senior citizens cruising down pedestrian paths on mobility scooters with the dignified air of kings. A wonderful and almost fabricated world stretches out as far as the eye can see. It is not the kind of joy you get drunk on, any attempt at exaltation disturbs the peace. But it is there for the taking: behind a pair of sunglasses, on a bench overlooking the water, naming each duck as they waddle into the horizon.

**Part XV: Let’s Just Quickly Talk Agenda**

I thought that the most surprising thing about this particular morning was that I had actually woken up to go to my lecture. I sprawled across my seat watching the slides go by when suddenly, during the lecturer’s discussion of the camera lenses’ ability to objectively capture and frame reality, a picture of Donald Trump came up on the screen. The lecturer gestured to the image and said: 

_“So, you shoot someone from below,_ **_sadly this is a camera shooting but uh,_** _you shoot someone from below, this magnifies this guy’s sense of power, of who he is.”_

The comment came and went. Nobody laughed. They weren’t listening. I, however, experienced a distinct sense of whiplash. 

As someone who was in the US during the 2016 election, but hasn’t been around much since, I should really be desensitized to nonchalant fantasies of Trump’s assassination by now. I’ve heard them early, I’ve heard them often.  However, I must admit, I was slightly taken aback. It was a passé joke, so seamlessly delivered that I was inclined to think it was prepared, even practiced. But for what? And for who?

Each time I have called my father since I started university, he has jokingly asked me whether the ‘liberal brainwashing' had taken hold and until now, I had nothing to report. By all measures this was still rather tame, it just seemed a little out of left field.

Perhaps there should be an academic avenue to discuss the potential advantages of putting Trump to death execution style. Academia, after all, has no bounds. However, stating it as a given during a 9AM lecture that is not inherently political, in a room sparsely filled by non-American students, in a foreign country which hasn’t been impacted in any measurable way by Trump’s presidency is so expected and yet still so… strange. 

You couldn’t imagine it said about any other world leader, past or present, regardless of how tyrannical their reign has been. Is the US so truly all-encompassing that the same cultural relativism that is extended to the Post-Soviet bloc, Latin America, and the Middle East cannot possibly be applied towards its analysis? Or are countries like the Netherlands so unwilling to reckon with their own torrid history (and habitual blackface) that it’s easier to use Trump as a constant deflection? The inconsistencies are flagrant but even asking these questions is already digging too deep .  

Loudly yearning for Trump’s demise isn’t a political conversation, it’s small talk. Since 2016,  Anti-Trump rhetoric has truly given The Weather™ a run for its money as the most predictable and boring icebreaker in the world. Paradoxically, the normalization of this discourse has actually made Trump more familiar and personable, in the same way that people tend to be the harshest towards the ones closest to them. It is, after all, a testament to Trump's transfixing influence, uniting even the most multicultural of environments in a shared denigration of his person, a practice that is seemingly justified and, above all, absolutely necessary due to his unabashed and unapologetic display of ego. 

In America, comments like these contribute to creating unnecessary, but highly profitable, media traffic in lieu of actual criticism, focusing attention on ‘culture wars’ rather than policy. But here policy is completely irrelevant altogether. It is simply en vogue to hate the Big Bad Arrogant Orange Man.  

  

**Part XVI: Simulacrum, Interrupted**

If you walk through Dam Square, rain or shine, you will see an individual in an off-brand Mickey Mouse suit making the rounds. Lovingly nicknamed Ratty Mike, I have come to appreciate his singular presence from afar.

At first I thought it was just nostalgia. After all, Ratty Mike has all the energy of a man trying to sell you his mixtape on Ocean Drive,  a vibe that I have sorely missed since leaving Miami. However, I have come to realize that it is something beyond that, something far deeper that has drawn me to this character.

Ratty Mike does not stand on a pedestal like the skull-masked silhouettes who have found dignity in their resemblance to statues. Mike isn’t just something to look at, there is a yearning for connection extended through each dirty white-gloved gesture. Sometimes, Mike is dancing around like the most carefree kid at a Bar-mitzvah. At other times, Mike is sullenly sitting on a crate, one gloved hand holding up the massive head and the other lethargically warding off pigeons. One day, Mike was nowhere to be seen, and I truly felt the full extent of the unexpected absence.

In this whole act, there is not a single inkling of immersion, the repeated encounters only serve as imperatives to construct the backstory, to see beyond the mask. In this sense, the purchase of the off-brand Mickey Mouse suit embeds itself into the narrative as a radically life-changing decision. There was a time before Ratty Mike’s emergence onto the scene, a gap just begging to be filled. This moment could have its own montage: starting from the idea’s conception to the exchange of the 50 or so euros at the cashier desk, all culminating towards those triumphant first steps in fresh black mouse slippers.

If only the narrative stopped there, but it goes on. And suddenly, you are not so detached anymore. Suddenly, you know far more than you ever wanted to. You can hear the intrusive sound of the morning alarm, you can imagine the drudgery of once again encasing your body in that stuffy synthetic, and you can feel the exhaustion and relief when it’s finally time to unzip the uniform. As the mouse suit slides off of your body, you can already taste the cardboard-flavored dread of doing it all over tomorrow. And yet, through all of this, the human face underneath the mask remains obscured. Somehow, imagining the person inside proves to be too painful of a thought experiment.

**~intermission~**

There is an existential truth to Mike, a facade that is almost completely erased by virtue of its plush exaggeration. The pitch black eye holes scream: _“This is what you wanted, right? Cheap entertainment. This is what you come here for”_, while the stitched-on cartoonish smile reassures each passerby that this demand is happily fulfilled. If Disneyland had not been, as Baudrillard so eloquently put it, _“a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real”,_ then we would not have Mike; an assertion of the real made possible by the mythology of the fiction. Ratty Mike’s shortcomings are made apparent through the instant recognition of the referent. The entrails of the fantasy splattered all over the cobblestones of Dam Square. As such, ‘the costume’, too ill-fitting to be a viable disguise or illusion, becomes a confession. .

And there it is, the discomforting gospel of Ratty Mike on Dam Square:

There is no Magic Kingdom, there is no Minnie Mouse, there is no happily-ever-after. There are only tourists and their children, there are only pigeons and the occasional pictures, there are only beads of sweat and a constant search for distraction. Day-in, Day-out.

**Part XVII: Real Sees Real**

_Background_

In a series of fortuitous events back in October, after an accommodation hunt which gifted me with my first strands of gray hair, I found a lovely room in Noord, in an apartment building right above an Albert Heijn. Over the past 8 months, that Albert Heijn has seen me in all of my guises. If you look back through the security camera footage, you can observe me at the start of my life there: bright-eyed and bushy-tailed on some early mornings, buying bananas as if I cared about my health. And you can watch it devolve from there - flying in 5 minutes before closing time, grabbing a crate of Apple Bandit cider and a bottle of barbecue sauce in outfits which could charitably be considered pajamas yet realistically are best described as ‘scoundrel attire’. 

But this isn’t about my questionable grocery store fits, which, BTW, would land me in every 2000s tabloid if I were famous during the indisputable golden age of celebrity. And despite my self-centered tendencies which are clearly displayed in the previous sentence, this isn’t really about me at all. This is about the man behind the cigarette counter.

_Context_

Let’s set the scene: the cigarette counter in the Albert Heijn is worked by four Muslim women and one Dutch man. Each time I smoke all the cheap cigarettes I smuggle in from Moscow, I am forced to go downstairs and admit that - yes, my addiction is indeed strong enough to make me spend €11.50 every other day on a pack of Marlboro Reds XXL (40 cigs). I’m not as proud of it as I would've been at 18, but youthful extremism is how we get here and physical and psychological dependency is how we stay.  

_Exposition_

The first time I went down to buy a shamefully overpriced pack of delicious death, sometime in early November, a Dutch man (blond, broad, 26-ish) was working the counter. I smiled politely, tucked my hair behind my ear and said, “Marlboro Red…the big one, please.”

My voice was a bit shaky, I hadn’t asked for cigarettes in a while, and to be honest, despite remaining loyal to the brand since 2014, I have never fully gotten the hang of the word ‘Marlboro’.

Thankfully, my worries proved themselves to be unfounded; it came out fine, a little heavy on the ‘L’, but fine.

He turned around to get them off the shelf, first trailing off to the Marlboro Golds and then down to the Reds - really taking his time. Finally, after vocally guiding his hand like a claw machine, he turned around and set that fat, red, juicy pack of carcinogenic bliss on the counter in front of me.

The packaging had a picture of a morbidly obese man (sans shirt), taken from the most unflattering back angle I could possibly imagine. I’m sure that if I just happened to walk in on this in a hospital room or a sauna, I would’ve been grossed out and maybe even a little disturbed. But standing there, staring at a pack that would soon become mine - he ceased to be repugnant. I could almost feel the cigarettes in my hand, I could almost smell the faint tar aroma, and, at that point, I’d be willing to give that poor diabetic bloke a massage just to take that pack home with me.

The Dutchie looked over at me, breaking me out of my nicotine deprived daydream: ‘Do you have your ID?’

“Yeah, of course”

 I pulled out my American passport, flipped to the picture page, and angling the holographic stars directly towards his pupils, proudly presented it to him.

 He looked at me, then looked at the picture.

 Looked at me again. Looked at the picture. 

Then, seemingly satisfied with my age, he scanned the cigarettes and allowed me to complete the transaction, faintly wishing me to ‘have a good day’ as I rushed out to get my fix.

_Rising Action - 2 Days Later_

My cigarettes ended at around 8:45PM and I ran downstairs like a maniac, forgetting that I still had an entire hour before I was doomed to a night of nicotine withdrawal. And there he was again, standing at the counter, looking exactly the same as the first time I had the pleasure of making his acquaintance.

 This time, I walked up confidently; he wouldn’t bite and I knew it. But despite what I thought was a convincingly entitled demeanor, he once again asked for my ID.

 I was surprised, I’m not gonna lie. I quickly tried to make peace with the idea that perhaps I’m not as memorable as I think I am, flashed him my stars and stripes booklet and took my pack.  

 This time it depicted a confused blond boy looking cautiously at a cigarette as if it might spontaneously combust.

_Climax - 2 More Days Later_

10AM, two cigarettes left in the sheltered preteen picture pack. I decided to play it safe and top up before going to my lecture so I could smoke decadently -  never denying myself the luxury of a cigarette.

To give a little context, and I don’t want to brag, but this was back when I more or less cared about my appearance; the eyeliner was razor sharp, the cheekbones were chiseled, and the lashes were at their optimal batting volume.

 I strolled up to the counter, feeling unequivocally like ‘that bitch’, and placed my usual order.

He reached straight for the Marlboro Reds, picking out a pack with what I found to be the most ridiculously decrepit-looking woman in a wheelchair, and trust me, I’ve seen a few paraplegics in my day.

 ‘He knows what I want’, I thought, that warm fuzzy feeling of being recognized as  a ‘regular’ spreading through my chest.

 So when he decided to shatter my small-town living fantasy and proceeded to ask me for my ID a THIRD time, I could not contain myself.

 “But…but…you know me,” I said, trying to sound as cool and collected as possible while delivering one of the most ego-crushing lines to a man I have seen 3 times in the past week. .

 “Oh yeah I remember you, but it’s the rule, I have to ask you every time.”

 “Every time? Forever?”

 “I’m sorry, but I’m afraid so.”

_Epilogue_

Since November, I have gone down countless times to buy cigarettes. When I finally started catching them on their shifts, the four Muslim girls who work the counter have asked me for my ID a total of one time each. After that, they started giving me the pack of cigarettes, taking my crumpled notes which I always had at the ready, giving me back my change (when applicable), and telling me to have a good day/night - an interaction which took about 10 seconds in total and left me feeling like I just went to my favorite neighborhood Bodega.

The Dutchman has asked for my passport every single time. The time I spend rummaging through my stuff, he spends apologizing for having to ask and expressing how “fucking stupid” these rules are. I have practically emptied my bag on the cigarette counter on multiple occasions. 

He knows where I go to university and my program of study, a topic that came up when I slammed my student ID on the counter only to realize that it didn’t show my date of birth. 

The last time that I was there, through some harmless teasing on my part, I found out that he actually remembers my birth date. And yet, each time he’s at the counter, he looks at me and mumbles “you know what I’m gonna ask you”, and, boy oh boy, I really do.

I haven’t had the heart to tell him that none of the other girls have asked me for my ID since fall - partly because I don’t want to make him feel lame and partly because I’m scared that he would snitch them out, which is something that I would never want to be mixed up in.

After all this time, I really can’t say that I have any respect for the Dutchman, like at all. But his unyielding adherence to the same rules which he claims to despise really shows that a man can be committed to something – his own fear of administrative consequences.
