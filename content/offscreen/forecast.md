**The Forecast**

April 20th – May 20th

On April 20th, we step off the Aries comet into the warm fleece of Taurus season. Now I know what you’re thinking. Taurus season is boring, but don’t be so quick to judge the bull by the horns. Taurus gets a bad reputation for their stubbornness and inflexibility but let me tell you, sweetie, there is no hedonism like Taurean hedonism. This sign’s corporal sensorium is always ready to receive pleasure, be it through one sense or all five. Be gone, panic-attack inducing Aries mania! It’s time to indulge in all the luxuries our lives have to offer. It is time to take your inner-child out for a stroll. Just buy them some ice-cream and tell them they’re a good kid, it won’t kill you. Then, when you put that rascal down for nap-time, treat yourself to anything your heart desires…because you’re worth it!

Also, just a little note, Uranus is in Taurus this year so you might have to deal with some revelations about yourself which will kick your ass into gear for the rest of the lunar year [pun intended and I am not ashamed]. But other than that, if it all goes according to Mother Moon, this will be the time of the most elaborate skincare routines and the coziest of naps; a time of gifts from the most thoughtful person (you) to the most deserving (you); a time to give yourself over to absolute pleasure. So go invest in a nice corset and a heated blanket and start being selfish, baby.

**The Forecast**

May 21st – June 20th

I’m gonna be real with you: Geminis are a goddamn Gemi-nightmare. Gemini season, however, is actually a pretty marvelous time if you go along with it. 

“How?” you might ask. 

Well, here’s the deal: all that self-awareness that you’ve been building up this entire year – now is the time to drop it like it’s hot. Talk like you have a hunch that your vocal chords won’t work tomorrow. Say everything that needs to be said as well as everything that doesn’t. Make people uncomfortable without knowing it. Be as annoying as you truly are and lose that pesky ability to read the room to know when it’s time to stop. This is the season where every homeless person you meet could be an undercover billionaire. The most unexpected series of circumstances could be waiting for you right around the corner.

So: take chances, be obnoxious and wild, don’t take no for an answer. I know it’s hard, I know it goes against everything you have been socialized to do, but think of it this way: Geminis are the most notorious sign of the zodiac and that’s why they know better than anyone that all press is good press. You can rant about them all day long, you can call them every name under the sun but, honey, deep down you know it’s better to be talked about than forgotten. I implore you to think of all the things that you missed out on because you were too shy or self-conscious or insecure, and damn them all to hell. This season, shame is not a feeling we’re acquainted with. Shake off the chains of public opinion which you have worn for so long and dance, baby, dance.
