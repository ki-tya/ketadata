9. Collective Mission Statement (Draft)

We exist for friendship, destruction, and purpose.
We believe raw ideas matter more than polished ones.
We create art from conversations, cigarettes, and real life.
We are not a studio, not a brand—
we are four idiots, one mic, and a story.
Our only real product is soul.

First 30 Days:

Finalize studio space (paint, WiFi, lighting).

CORE PRINCIPLE

Magic People does not have to be perfect.
It must be real, soulful, watchable, followable, and alive.
It is a myth we build while living it.
