**Introduction**

My name is Elena Chigibaeva. I am a Co-founder and Project Manager at Techaim, a public foundation which works to cultivate and empower the next generation of women in STEM in Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia.

**Connection**

I met Elvira in [YEAR], during her first year in college, when she was just 16 years old. At the time, my team was working on a project which facilitated the development of environmentally sustainable methods of agriculture by inviting experts from India to agrarian regions in Kyrgyzstan to share their expertise with local farmers. Our collaboration began with Elvira translating these meetings from English to Kyrgyz, a skill which is hard to come by in these regions, especially in somebody so young. Even then, Elvira displayed remarkable confidence, maturity and ambition. In cultivating these qualities from a young age, she has managed to sustain a trajectory of exponential growth over the years, continuously moving onto bigger and more complex projects. 

  

**Growth + Time**

[Work placement project - collaboration details] 

Along with her international growth in business, Elvira has also taken on the responsibility of mentoring students and young professionals from [WHERE], training their business development skills and preparing them to compete at an international level. Her zeal for economic empowerment, especially of young women, is something very dear to my heart and I have found that Elvira has a great capacity for applying her business knowledge and acumen towards developing innovative methods and programs for nurturing, training and mentoring young talent.  

  

I am pleased to know that Elvira is planning on applying her knowledge and experience towards research in social psychology and highly recommend her for the PHD program at Stanford. I am certain that, over the years, she has gathered plenty of material regarding the ways in which culturally embedded values affect the daily lives and decision-making within a business environment. 

  

From the day I met her, Elvira has always remained tireless and deliberate in the pursuit of her goals. She has proven to be an unstoppable force, always expanding towards new horizons. Time after time, she has demonstrated an uncanny ability to adapt to any project, combining her rigorous work ethic with deep-rooted values to achieve outstanding results. I can therefore characterize her as an extremely capable and hardworking person, with a wide array of skills that will undoubtedly inform and enhance any research or project which she plans to undertake in the future.
