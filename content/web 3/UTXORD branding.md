UTXORD is an inscription service and market platform for Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain. We are focused on developing tools and functionality for users to be able to inscribe their projects with ease while remaining loyal to the core principles of Bitcoin. Both the security of our users and the integrity of their ideas and projects is of prime importance to us.

  

We are mechanics for the Ordinals protocol – automating difficult tasks and ensuring a smooth user experience. We build things, we fix things, we pay attention to common issues and try to resolve them. UTXORD is a one-stop shop – inscribe, explore, collect. We are always looking to improve the security and operability of our platform, adding new features and iterating on those already in production, based on our own ideas as well as community feedback. 

  

  

  

**The culture of Bitcoin is different from other chains. It is not about hyped out cash grabs with little to no personal investment, both financially and emotionally. In Bitcoin, we are PEERS. A TRUSTLESS NETWORK that is constantly in DEVELOPMENT. In order to get independent prod-users to experiment with new media, there must be a pathway to entry. Many people still do not feel safe even buying Bitcoin, much less using it as a carrier for their ideas.** 

  

**We are Bitcoiners - SECURITY-conscious, UNPRETENTIOUS, reliant on FIRST PRINCIPLES rather than trying to appease mass market trends. We are not cutting corners, nor sacrificing security in favor of usability.  We are playing the LONG GAME - Bitcoin, and the ARTIFACTS inscribed on it, grows in value over time. There is a beauty in SIMPLICITY, just like that exhibited by Satoshi’s original white paper. We are focused on simplifying user experience while remaining loyal to the core principles of Bitcoin. The culture of Bitcoin and the culture on Bitcoin are intertwined and if we are inscribing tattoos on the obelisk of the Bitcoin blockchain, with all the mechanics involved, we want to be made aware of the PERMANENCE and SIGNIFICANCE of this endeavor.** 

  

**UTXORD is both the user’s workshop and their exhibition. It is a one-stop shop - inscribe, explore, collect. UTXORD is focused on inscribing and amplifying experimental on-chain projects by making it easier to inscribe and showcase work in a way that is DIGNIFIED. From the avant-garde to early net-art, independent works have reimagined and transformed mediums therefore the INTEGRITY of the artist and the artistic endeavor is of prime importance. We do not want the users' inscriptions to be thrown in with the rest of the noise of the industry. Projects and ideas should be given the ATTENTION and RESPECT they deserve. With our platform serving as both the means and ends for their point-of-view, both content and form. We provide them a CLEAN SPACE with HEAVY ARTILLERY TOOLS to build and inscribe their VISION on Bitcoin.** 

  

**Bitcoin is all about TRUST. And we want REAL PEOPLE with a point of view and something to say to trust our platform.** 

  

  

**What is REAL?** 

  

**Decentralized money is a form of resistance to the power of centralized authority.** 

  

**Art is also a form of resistance.** 

  

**Engineering is an art in itself, one that becomes unnoticeable if done right.** 

  

**We want to direct focus on the production of REAL THINGS - HARD THINGS. Just like Bitcoin is HARD MONEY with its value justified by proof-of-work –  the artifacts, projects and ideas inscribed on the blockchain are inherently meaningful by that same logic. We should not shy away from radical ideas. Inscribing is irreversible, it is weighty - ideas should be conceptually concrete, well-executed. Thermodynamics is the core of Bitcoin - for real VALUE to exist there must be a CORE. Until Bitcoin reaches 21 million, there is space on the blockchain, after that nothing else can be added. This in-built SCARCITY and LONG TIME PREFERENCE mean that you are in fact leaving behind a LEGACY, something that is bound to outlive you.** 

  

**We definitely believe in EXPLOITS - there is nothing wrong with making money, especially when it helps the Bitcoin blockchain. The rising tide raises all ships. Artistic production is itself exploitative, mostly of the self but also of the world around us and we want to help everybody get what’s coming to them. However, there is more to it than just money. Technology should expand our horizons and help keep the world free. The next Duchamp’s urinal fountain could very well be inscribed on Bitcoin… and we want to be the ones to do it.** 

  

**Mechanics - people who build things, people who fix things** 

**Gear Motif**:

- **Aesthetically pleasing - like buddhist mandalas**
- **Ordinals symbol in the middle**
- **Symbolizes building, co-operation, inextricability**
