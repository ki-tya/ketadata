**VIBE CHECK 2024: Insights from Inscribing Miami**

  

**Context:**

The insights gathered from the “Inscribing Miami” conference highlighted both the challenges and opportunities within the current Ordinals ecosystem. The Ordinals marketplace landscape is competitive, with established players dominating, making it difficult for UTXORD to differentiate and capture a sufficient market. However, the innovative features and creator-focused tools at UTXORD garnered attention, emphasizing the potential to position it as a cutting-edge creator studio rather than a general marketplace.

  

**Key Insights**

  

**1. Challenges of Positioning UTXORD as a Marketplace**

 • Perception Issue: Most potential users assume UTXORD is a secondary marketplace and equate it to established platforms, leading to disinterest in switching.

 • Entrenched Competition: Established marketplaces dominate, leaving little incentive for users to explore new options.

  

**2. Appeal of Advanced Features**

 • Features like Genetic Provenance, Lazy Mining, and Create With Me generate genuine interest, particularly among creators. These tools appeal to the growing demand for provenance tracking and user-friendly creation workflows.

  

**3. Provenance as a Hot Topic**

 • Technical accuracy and functionality are highly valued by the Ordinals community. Provenance and technical innovations, like resizing or previews, are key differentiators.

 • Mistake-proofing and user guidance during the inscription process (e.g., preview functionality) are critical.

  

**4. Barriers to Entry for Create With Me**

 • The manual process for accessing Create With Me is too time-consuming for new users. Users should be able to engage immediately—tokens or free-generation features would make the process more seamless.

  

**5. Event Promotional Material**

 • Business cards were effective but should link directly to actionable content (e.g., a specific tool or feature).

 • Stickers and physical promo items are useful for branding and should be tied to upcoming collection promotions or features.

  

**6. Community and Network Opportunities**

 • The Ordinals artist community remains relatively small but engaged. Collaborations with artists and referral-based growth could significantly increase UTXORD’s visibility.

**Strategic Suggestions**

Current Challenge: Positioning UTXORD solely as a marketplace creates confusion and limits appeal.

  

Solution:

 • Highlight UTXORD’s technical innovations and position it as the go-to platform for cutting-edge tools and user-centric features.

 • Market UTXORD as a “Creator Studio for Ordinals” that empowers artists with tools like Genetic Provenance and Lazy Mining.

  

Action Steps:

 • Update the website homepage to emphasize creator tools rather than marketplace functionality.

 • Develop content (blogs, tutorials, videos) showcasing how the features make inscription more intuitive and technically advanced.

  

2. Simplify the User Journey

  

Current Challenge: Barriers to entry, particularly for tools like Create With Me, deter casual users.

  

Solution:

 • Introduce free demo tools that allow users to experiment with features (e.g., generating basic assets without full inscription).

 • Preload accounts with tokens for new users following specific promotional links.

  

Action Steps:

 • Implement a “Quick Start” option for Create With Me to reduce friction.

 • Develop easy-to-follow onboarding materials for users with minimal technical knowledge.

  

3. Build Trust with Provenance and User Guidance

  

Current Challenge: Provenance is a priority for users, but mistakes in inscription are irreversible.

  

Solution:

 • Develop robust preview and error-proofing features to make inscription seamless.

 • Educate users about resizing and other technical considerations to ensure optimal results.

  

Action Steps:

 • Add preview functionality to the inscription process, highlighting potential errors or optimization opportunities.

 • Create educational materials about the benefits of Genetic Provenance and resizing.

  

  

4.Strengthen the Community and Partnerships

  

Current Challenge: Limited visibility and collaboration within the small Ordinals artist community.

  

Solution:

 • Collaborate with key figures and artists from the community to launch exclusive collections.

 • Focus on community-driven events like live inscription workshops or artist Q&A sessions.

  

Action Steps:

 • Reach out to key contacts to co-create projects or campaigns.

 • Consider collection narratives such as Troy’s “pizza ninjas” to inspire creative branding for Ordinals collectibles.

  

5. Enhance Event Promo and Referrals

  

Current Challenge: Business cards and promo materials are effective but lack actionable follow-through.

  

Solution:

 • Redesign business cards and event materials to direct users to specific features

 • Implement a referral program to incentivize users to bring new creators onto the platform.

  

Action Steps:

 • Launch sticker campaigns promoting upcoming collections or features.

 • Establish a referral program offering rewards for both the referrer and the referred user (e.g., free inscriptions or tokens).

**Possible Next Steps**

  

 1. Website Changes:

 • Focus the homepage on tools and features, positioning UTXORD as a creator studio.

 • Include prominent calls to action for key features like Create With Me.

**Questions for Pepelangelo**

  

On Authenticity and Provenance

 1. Memes are often remixed and reshared, making ownership and authenticity difficult to track. How does the blockchain and Web3 help establish the provenance of your work while honoring meme culture’s collaborative origins?

 2. Your work integrates classical art with meme culture, which thrives on anonymity and replication. How do you balance the authenticity of your artistic vision with the inherently decentralized nature of memes?

 3. By minting your works as NFTs, you secure their provenance. How does this impact the way collectors and audiences perceive your art compared to traditional or physical art forms?

 4. Do you see Web3 as a tool to ensure that meme-based art maintains its authenticity and value, or do you think it risks commercializing a format meant to be freely shared?

 5. Pepe has been widely appropriated in internet culture, often stripped of its original meaning. Does anchoring your works on the blockchain help reclaim and recontextualize Pepe within an artistic framework?

  

On the Role of Web3 in Art

 6. Web3 offers artists tools to authenticate and preserve their work in a way that traditional galleries cannot. Do you see this as empowering, or does it introduce new challenges for artists like you?

 7. In a world where memes are copied endlessly, how do you ensure that your pieces maintain a sense of originality and distinction within the Web3 ecosystem?

 8. Do you think the immutability of the blockchain enhances the cultural significance of meme art by offering it a permanent place in digital history?

 9. What role do you think provenance plays in legitimizing meme art as a serious movement in both traditional and digital art markets?

 10. Do you see your NFT artworks as having dual authenticity—one as a digital asset tied to the blockchain and another as a cultural artifact within meme culture?

  

On Artistic Identity and Cultural Ownership

 11. The blockchain makes it possible to prove your authorship, but how do you approach the cultural ownership of Pepe, which belongs to a collective internet consciousness?

 12. In meme culture, authorship is often obscured or irrelevant. How does anchoring your work in Web3 shift the focus back to the artist while still honoring the collaborative spirit of the internet?

 13. Do you feel a responsibility to preserve or reshape Pepe’s cultural narrative as part of your work, given that your pieces now carry the authenticity of the blockchain?

 14. How does provenance through Web3 impact the way traditional art audiences view meme-based art? Does it lend credibility to a format they may otherwise dismiss?

 15. Do you think blockchain-enabled provenance gives meme artists like yourself more creative freedom, knowing your contributions can always be attributed back to you?

  

On the Future of Authenticity in Web3

 16. How do you see the concept of authenticity evolving in a Web3 world, where every digital artwork is traceable and verifiable?

 17. As more artists use blockchain to establish provenance, do you think this will create a divide between meme art created for free-sharing and meme art created for collection and trade?

 18. Do you worry that the focus on provenance and monetary value in Web3 could diminish the playful, chaotic essence of memes? Or do you see it as a new chapter in their evolution?

 19. What happens to authenticity when meme art created on-chain inevitably gets copied and re-shared off-chain? Does this blur the lines of ownership, or is it part of the art’s identity?

 20. How do you see your role as an artist in defining what “authenticity” means in a space where the digital and the cultural constantly overlap?
