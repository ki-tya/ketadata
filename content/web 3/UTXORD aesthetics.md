1. **LANDING PAGE**

- Remove Tagline or make smaller - ‘inscribing on edge’ makes no sense, we can do ‘inscribing on-chain’ but then its double, should just be like the market name 
- U T X O R D - central on page 
- Small tagline - “on-chain inscribing”
- ENTER INVITE CODE - underneath & smaller 

  

1. **FRONT PAGE**

- Change collections and inscribe around OR make the top just ‘Featured’ and then the bottom collections to new releases
- Maybe add like a ‘Inscribe’ plank with functionality like ‘Inscribe Genetic Collections’, ‘Make Drafts’
- Use article about genetic collections as place-holder + find visual for article - button ‘read more’ 
- Use video reel for featured collections as fishka
- Remove Explore 

  

1. **LOGO**

- More minimalistic + ord symbol
- **UTXORD**
- UTXORD
- UTXORD
- U T X O R D

  

1. **OTHER**

- I want to add artistic statements to projects
- I want to add timers for releases
- I don’t like this green & I don’t understand why everyone is clinging onto it so hard

- Associates with tinder heart
- Stars on letterboxd
- Twitter retweets
- Is used by other crypto companies
- Does not fit with theme 
- Looks cheap and scammy

- MY SUGGESTION: GRAY

- UTXORD is a one-stop-shop - Inscribe, Explore, Collect

What I do not like about this:

- Rounded corners
- Ugly microphone
- The font
- That green color
- It tells no story, it inspires nothing
- The world in the O is a cool idea but it looks cartoonish and corny

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 What I do not like about this:

- That ugly button
- Those ugly pictures
- Too much caps lock all together
- Looks cramped
- Once again - no story, no visual representation of provenance
- LOOKS UGLY AND CHEAP

What is good: movement, simplicity, centrality, boldness, “vibe” setting

  

  

  

  

  

  

OUR STRENGTHS:

The name is great- i want mechanical, motorcycle-looking font

  

Vibe is “under the hood”, vibe is mechanical, vibe is engineering on show

  

SQUARE THE EDGES PLEASE

  

  

  

GIVE ME ELECTRIC CIRCUIT - GIVE ME SOMETHING REAL

There is a difference between Bitcoin digital artifacts and NFTs on other chains. 

Bitcoin is **smart & direct & mechanical**

NFTs are **stupid & ‘cute’ & bubbly**

  

Suggestion for overall vibe: Mechanical like a motor shop, emphasis on Bitcoin ‘building’, focus on technical features, more cypherpunky less cutesy

  

1. Square Edges - more “real” & bold and stark 
![[Pasted image 20251107062600.png]]
E.g 1st pic current, 2nd with 0.5x angle

Front Page Notes:

Change font - something sharper

Replace Microphone - maybe with gear (see point 3)

Direct people to read genetic provenance paper

Need visual metaphor for genetic provenance or just pretty AND SIMPLE diagram 

  

Focus on FEATURES first
