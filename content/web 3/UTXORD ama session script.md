Intro: 

Welcome, everyone! We're thrilled to have you here with us today, at our first AMA. At UTXORD, we are focused on securing the legacy of artists with on-chain provenance. We see these sessions as exclusive parties where artists and innovators in the Ordinals ecosystem come together to reveal the magic behind their projects. It's an opportunity to get an insider’s look into the creative and technical processes, offering a sneak peek before official launches.

  

Our today’s guests are: 

1. **XCPinata** – one of the early pioneer artists who started integrating art with blockchain technology. Kevin has been innovating in this space since 2014, working on a range of projects across Bitcoin and NFTs. 

2. **Jake Gallen** – CEO of Emblem Vault, the host of *The Jake Gallen Podcast* and a notable member of the community, where he showcases leaders, creators, and visionaries in the crypto industry. Jake spoke with a lot of people in the space and we’re excited to hear his insights.

3. **Steven Miller** - Steven Miller is a leading Strategic Advisor and Curator in the world of tokenized art. He’s the author of “All Eyes on Art,” a weekly collector’s digest that spotlights forthcoming art collections across all major blockchains, and he’s the host of “Color Commentary,” a weekly space on X that showcases Artists, Curators, Collectors and other Art Professionals while sharing insights into the evolving digital art landscape.

.  

Today, we’ll dive into the origins of digital art on blockchain, discuss the importance of provenance and ProtoGen, explore the role of AI in NFTs, and touch on Runes. And, perhaps most exciting of all, we’ll hear about the upcoming collection from Kevin! 

Kevin, Jake, how are you doing?

  

**Historical aspect**

(To Kevin) You are one of the first artists who started thinking and experimenting with the idea of how to make digital art unique other than printing it, can you please tell us more about these days? What technologies were back then and what were your most memorable first experiments?

(To Steven) When did you start diving into tokenized art? Were there any specific projects that inspired you to start exploring more on these topic? 

_Follow-up questions:_ 

(To Kevin) Which technology you can say was game-changing for you as for the artist?

(To Jake) Jake, based on what you’ve observed in the community, do you have anything you want to add? 

  

**Provenance**

(To Kevin) What was the approach to provenance back then?

(To Jake) Based on your experience, does provenance and authenticity of the art is something artists and collectors care about in the Ordinals community?  
(To Steven) Same question for Steven, do you think provenance is currently a hot topic for artists and collectors? 

  

**Ordinals**

_(Kevin and Jake)_ How did you get into the Ordinals protocol and what do you like about it? What is so special about securing provenance on the Bitcoin blockchain?

_Follow-up question:_  Do you guys recall any stories of when having strong provenance helped to protect their work? Do you recall any scams due to the lack of provenance?

_Follow-up question (optional):_ Do you recall any scams due to the lack of provenance?

  

**ProtoGen**

(To Kevin) So here in UTXORD, we’ve designed ProtoGen to help prevent exactly these kinds of issues with provenance. Kevin, you’ve been one of the artists who admired the technology, could you please explain to those who hear about it for the first time, what is ProtoGen and how it works?

(To Jake)_:_ Jake, how do you see ProtoGen changing the way artists protect their work and establish their legacy?”

  

**Upcoming Collection**

(To Kevin) By the way, a spoiler alert! Kevin is about to launch this new collection on UTXORD soon, so guys stay tuned for the updates and be ready for something really special. Kevin, could you tell us more about this upcoming collection? What’s the concept behind and what inspired you to create it?”

  

**AI**

(To Kevin, Jake, and Steven) Jake, Kevin, how do you think AI influenced the NFT space? Have you heard of or know any curious experiments AI experiments that artists or builders run within the ecosystem?_  
Follow-up from us:_ What do you guys think about creating the art collection with the community, meaning, your followers and fans?

  

**Runes**

(To Kevin, Jake, and Steven) There is one more question we want to cover today, what are your, guys, thoughts on Runes? Do you know any notable examples of how Runes’ve been utilized in the ecosystem?

_Follow-up from us: (optional)_ Kevin, have you happened to use them already?
