**Sun in Pisces 1st Decan**

You are endowed with a patient, good-natured, and noble character. Your Pisces Sun  has gifted you with  a rich imagination and an undeniable creative power. You have access to “higher dimensions” and are able to draw a great deal of strength from the spiritual world through your intuition .You have mastered the art of “going with the flow”.

On the other hand, you are also characterised by secrecy and a certain fear of self-expression. Sometimes your attempts at expressing yourself may seem too complicated or confusing. You do not always understand yourself and are afraid to be misunderstood by others.. Repressing this part of yourself may have manifested itself into a calm exterior , but periodically this  internal tension may come out  through uncontrollable outbursts of anger and hysteria.

For most of your life, you may have been  immersed within  yourself, living  in a certain state of apathy or prolonged daydream. You must learn to switch back to reality  in order to  recognize  that you are responsible for your own fate.

**Strengths**

Intuition and insight, developed empathy, sensitivity, and compassion. You are capable of loving purely  and selflessly. You adapt to changes with ease, you possess an  inner flexibility and calmness, as well as  a tolerance for other cultures, beliefs, and views.

**Weaknesses**

Lack of will, high suggestibility, a proclivity  for  all kinds of addictions and a tendency towards depression. You are predisposed  towards excessive daydreaming, confusion, and an inability to set goals. In an unhealthy mental state or toxic environment , promiscuity , irrationality , absent-mindedness, impracticality, and weak sociability can possibly develop.

**Moon in Capricorn**

Your subconscious desire is to seem self-sufficient and strong. Emotional dependence makes you very uncomfortable and you never want people to think that you rely on their help and support. You consider feelings to be a sign of weakness and do your best to conceal themto protect your image, but you need to understand that ‘absolute independence’ does not exist. 

  

While the Moon in Capricorn makes it easy for you to maintain your image and social status, it may also make you seem cold-hearted, stubborn and mean. You lack a certain sensitivity and are prone to being too rough in situations that  require a more gentle touch. You may also have some difficulty accepting change and going with the flow. The idea of bending the rules or improvising on the spot may cause you great distress. However, you do have a particular sense of humor that  is valued and appreciated within your social circle. 

  

For you, it is important to learn to express the kind and tender side of your personality. Stop taking life so seriously and try to see the humor in uncomfortable situations. This may help you loosen up and enjoy things in a new and profound way.  

  

**Moon in the 2nd House**

Your mood directly depends on your material welfare. You have a keen business sense and always seem to know where to invest in order to multiply your assets. You surround yourself with beautiful things which provide a sense of stability, making periods of change particularly difficult to deal with. You like to play it safe and prefer to have savings or moveable assets so that you can always enjoy the luxurious lifestyle to which you are accustomed. 

  

**Neptune in the 9th House**

You enjoy dreaming and fantasizing, and may sometimes get lost in your own world, making  it difficult for others to understand you. You may be drawn to getting an education, possibly in the medical or artistic field, but can become bored by institutional drudgery and the lack of new and fresh perspectives. 

You are captivated by foreign ideas and cultures and may dream of living overseas. The dogmatic beliefs within your own culture seem too banal and commonplace leading  you to seek answers in the philosophies and religions of other parts of the world. However, Neptune can cause confusion during your travels and distort how  you perceive the world around you. 

**Advantages**

Confidence in your ideas & beliefs, visual imagination (commonly associated with poets and artists), an unusual perspective on life, and access to secret knowledge. Your love for traveling extends to flights of fantasy. Theater, cinema, and the world of imagination are a source of inspiration and influence you a lot. 

**Disadvantages**

Dependence on a spiritual mentor, risk of joining a cult, unfounded dislike or judgment of people from afar, confused connections with foreign countries and dangerous travels, especially by water.  


**Recommendations**

Live in foreign countries and go on faraway trips. This will help you deepen your knowledge and understanding of the world. Spend time developing your critical thinking and ensuring  that your ideas and beliefs have a solid foundation.
