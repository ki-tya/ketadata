Hi {{ first_name }}, 

А как вы относитесь к выдаче продуктов Benefit в физических магазинах в шаговой доступности от ваших клиентов? 

The _Buy Online Pick Up In-Store_ trend is growing. Косметический бренд, который предлагает больше всех точек выдачи в США на сегодня - это Sephora, 2600 точек выдачи товара. Благодаря этому, у клиентов Sephora есть возможность получать свои товары раньше всех остальных косметических брендов. Сроки получения товара из Sephora со всеми предложенными способами доставки составляет 1-3 дня. 

The Holiday Peak Season is approaching, shipping providers will be pressed for time to deliver the increasing volume of orders. Customers will order a lot of products last minute and inundate customer support with questions about delays. 

Если доставить 100 заказов в одну точку выдачи заказов на районе вместо развоза всех посылок по домам - вы сможете значительно сократить сроки доставки. Что особенно понравится вашим клиентам в Holiday Season Rush. 

Чтобы предложить такую опцию доставки клиенту, вам не обязательно иметь свои магазины. Your customers can choose any of our **23,700 stores** and come to pick up their packages from there. 

**We work with:** Walgreens, Dollar Tree, FedEx offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, coffee shops, and shipping offices. As well as with multiple shipping providers and local carriers, which are united on our logistics platform. 

Do you think Benefit Cosmetics customers might need this option to get their orders without delays during the Holiday Peak Season? 

Please feel free to give me a call at your convenience or [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/o-nikitina/30min) with us. I would love to show you how this can be readily implemented.

  

Best regards,

Hi {{ first_name }}, 

How do you feel about the possibility of Benefit products delivered to physical pick-up locations which are within walking distance of your customers?

The _Buy Online Pick Up In-Store_ trend is growing. Out of all cosmetic brands in the US, Sephora currently offers the most pick-up locations, with 2,600 points of delivery. This allows Sephora customers to receive their products faster than other cosmetic brands. The delivery time for Sephora products, considering all the possible shipping options, is 1-3 days. 

The Holiday Peak Season is approaching, shipping providers will be pressed for time to deliver the increasing volume of orders. Customers will order a lot of products last minute and inundate customer support with questions about delays. 

If orders can be shipped to a single pickup location, rather than delivered to each address separately, shipping time can be significantly reduced, which will be particularly appreciated during the Holiday Season Rush. 

You don’t need your own locations to offer your customers this shipping option. Your customers can choose any of our **23,700 stores** and come to pick up their packages from there. 

**We work with:** Walgreens, Dollar Tree, FedEx offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, coffee shops, and shipping offices. As well as with multiple shipping providers and local carriers, which are united on our logistics platform. 

Do you think Benefit Cosmetics customers might need this option to get their orders without delays during the Holiday Peak Season?

Hi {{ first_name }}, 

  

I hope my previous email found you well. If not, here is a quick reminder.

  

The best thing about Via.Delivery’s pickup locations is that they are located within 3-10 minutes' driving distance to most residents in the US. 

  

Via.Delivery does not replace any of your current shipping options, your customers simply get a new shipping option to choose from.

  

Do you think Benefit Cosmetics customers would enjoy an expedited shipping experience at no additional cost? Please feel free to [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/o-nikitina/30min) with us or give me a call to get more details.

  

Best,

Elie

Reserve Bar

LN templates

Hi {{ first_name }},

I see a growing tendency of online alcohol vendors delivering their products to pick-up locations, due to the fact that customers are not always at home to receive their order. For example, Wine currently has 20, 000 physical pick-up locations. 

  

What are your thoughts on the matter? Do you think Reserve Bar could benefit from utilizing the 23,000 pick-up locations which we represent?

  

Wine

LN templates

Hi Jesse! Great to be connected here

  

I can see that your store offers its clients 20,000 pick-up locations. Would you be interested in 3 thousand additional points of delivery? We are also currently negotiating with CVS and Sam’s Club  
(600 Walmart stores) to provide e-commerce pick-up points at their locations. 

Mac Cosmetics

Hi Jesse! Great to be connected here

Mac is one of the few cosmetic brands that offer their customers the Buy Online Pickup In-Store option. Do you think Mac might benefit from 27,000 more physical stores to dispense its products?

**Kiko**

SL: 23 000+ pickup locations for Kiko

Email 1

Hi {{ first_name }}, 

I’m a big fan of Kiko and would love to contribute to your fantastic customer service experience. 

At the moment, Kiko: 

- Requests a minimum order of $40 for Free shipping
- If the order is less than $40 - the shipping price is $7.50
- Standard shipping delivers in 4-9 days 
- The fastest delivery is 2 days and costs $25 
- No pickup locations

The Holiday Peak Season is approaching, shipping providers will be pressed for time to deliver the increasing volume of orders. Customers will order a lot of products last minute and, after seeing their delivery options, inundate customer support with questions. 

**What if Kiko could get last-mile delivery in 2 days for $4+?** 

It will allow Kiko to:

- Request no minimum amount for Free shipping, as do Estee Lauder, Tarte Cosmetics, Vichy, etc.
- Deliver in 1-3 days like Sephora, Huda Beauty, Mac, etc.
- Provide the fastest delivery for less than $12 like Kylie, Yes Style, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty, etc.

The _Buy Online Pick Up In-Store_ trend is growing. That’s why my company Via.Delivery provides **last-mile delivery to safe pickup locations in 2-4 days**. Your customers can choose any of our **23,700 stores** and come to pick up their packages from there. 

**We work with:** Dollar Tree, FedEx offices, pharmacies, grocery stores, coffee shops, and shipping offices. As well as with multiple shipping providers and local carriers, which are united on our logistics platform. 

Do you think Kiko’s customers would appreciate an additional delivery option? It will help deliver orders fast, even during the upcoming holiday season. 

Please feel free to give me a call at your convenience or [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/o-nikitina/30min) with us. I would love to show you how this can be readily implemented.

Hi {{ first_name }}, 

  

I hope my previous email found you well. 

Cosmetics brands who have already started to offer the _Buy Online Pick Up In-Store_ option are: Sephora, Charlotte Tilbury Beauty (at CVS), all other products available at CVS and Walgreens. But there is no need for you to have your own stores or sign an agreement with pickup locations.

You can easily use ours. 

The best thing about Via.Delivery’s pickup locations is that they are located within 3-10 minutes' driving distance to most residents in the US. 

  

Via.Delivery does not replace any of your current shipping options, your customers simply get a new shipping option to choose from.

Email 1

Hi {{ first_name }}, 

My name is Olga, and I'm  huge fan of L’Occitane 💛 

However, I have noticed some issues with L'Occitane’s product delivery. I've been waiting for my order for ten days and still haven’t gotten it. Usually, it takes about 3-5 days. I would be happy to do something that might help.

My company Via.Delivery provides **last-mile delivery to safe pickup locations in 2-4 days** for e-commerce sites and stores the orders for seven days. Your customers can choose any of our **27,027 stores** and come to pick up their packages from there. 

**We work with:** Walgreens, Dollar General, as well as other pharmacies, grocery stores, coffee shops, and shipping offices. Our logistic platform unites multiple shipping providers and local carriers. 

Do you think L’Occitane customers might need this option to get their orders without delays during the upcoming Holiday season? 

Please feel free to [book a meeting](https://calendly.com/o-nikitina/30min) with me or give me a call. I would love to know more about your challenges and see what we can do for you.

Notes:

- United **on** logistics platform
- wildly out of time > pressed for time
- If not, please let me make this kind reminder - sounds weird

- Maybe: Here’s a quick follow-up (?)

- massively order > order a lot of product last minute
