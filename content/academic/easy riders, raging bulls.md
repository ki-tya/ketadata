Easy Riders Raging Bulls  
How the Sex N Drugs N Rock N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood by  
Peter Biskind

Note: I chose this book after there were issues getting the books I was originally supposed to read. This was the book that I wanted to read originally because I have an intense interest in Hollywood and a pipe-dream to someday direct. However, I thought this book would be too popular of a choice. Nevertheless, when I realized that I wouldn’t be able to read my first choices, this was the only book I wanted to read.

Introduction

Biskin sets the stage, acknowledging the traditions of Old Hollywood, their steady decay and and the entrance of the New Hollywood movement and the Film School Brats. Biskin is compelling in the way he describes the flailing studio system and excites the reader in much the same way the directors of the late 60’s excited the audience.

Chapter 1

This chapter focuses on Bonnie & Clyde which became a symbol for the New Hollywood movement. Some people were ‘hip’ to it, some people weren’t. Bonnie & Clyde is one of my favorite movies although I was interested to find out that Warren Beatty had the same reservations about Faye Dunaway that I had while watching the movie. Namely, that she was too ‘upper-class’ to play Bonnie.

Chapter 2

The formation of BBS features interesting ‘characters’ and I was particularly fascinated by Bert Schneider. He seems like the kind of person I gravitate to, and would probably be in love with him had I known him. Hopper’s ‘crazy genius’ persona is also an interesting insight into the spirit of the time.

Chapter 3

This chapter introduces new faces, including Coppola about whom it is interesting to read as a young man. While I had venerated Coppola and was interested in his charismatic character, I had never heard of Altman before. His temperament is an interesting one, I’m very keen to watch some of his work.

Chapter 4

Bogdanovich was the central figure here and he struck me as too traditional for the movement. Schneider’s comment that his shots would ‘cut like butter’ made me rethink his claim to directorial greatness.  

Chapter 5

I was shocked to find out that The Godfather was not Coppola’s passion project and that his hand was forced by his own debts into directing the picture. It has made me rethink the entire film but also made me appreciate how much life he breathed into a picture he wasn’t particularly interested in.

Chapter 6

I relate to Hal Ashby on a far more personal level than any of the directors so far. It is striking to me how similar my own conversations about the human condition and culture are to the ones described in this chapter.  

Chapter 7

Finally putting a persona to the director behind The Exorcist has made the movie simultaneously more interesting and less scary. Friedkin is as dry as a cracker, excessively blunt, comes across more like a persona than an actual person. The audition of the twelve-year-old girl was a great piece of dialogue, I wish someone made the behind-the-scenes movie about the filming process.


Chapter 8

The rise of Martin Scorcese and George Lucas. Martin Scorcese is the only director who is exactly the way I expected him to be. I didn’t even know George Lucas made anything besides Star Wars so I enjoyed the background of his work. The ending of the chapter shows both directors proving executives wrong which is a truly triumphant high.  

Chapter 9  
Steven Spielberg is my least favorite film director and this chapter does very little to endear himself to me. Spielberg has become a director that you can’t get away from no matter how hard you try, and this ridiculous Jaws enterprise is quite infuriating.  

Chapter 10  
Paul Schrader is an interesting character, I have no idea what to make of him. I can understand the sibling rivalry between him and his brother and in many ways, Paul symbolizes the cutthroat nature of Hollywood.  

Chapter 11  
The Star Wars chapter, and the final nail in the coffin for New Hollywood. It really is a shame, but that’s my personal disdain for the comic book regurgitation that Lucas created the precedent for. Money becomes the major player, artists have to bow out.  

Chapter 12  
Coppola clinging onto the last bits of his sanity is a gruesome image, one that touched me more than I expected. I understand Coppola’s plight and the possibility of being so influential yet still struggling in the industry is one that I find quite terrifying.  

Chapter 13  
The wallpapers of New Hollywood peel back to reveal mold everywhere. Everyone is out of breath from the decade, Bogdanovich gets a sort of karmic retribution for idolizing himself, its a falling empire and it’s looks pitiful.  

Chapter 14  
New Hollywood ends, barely anyone manages to stay successful in the industry. The 70’s crash down leaving behind the scent of drugs and a recollection of the watershed films that will remain in the history. Hal Ashby dies and it breaks my heart a little bit. 


Easy Riders Raging Bulls Book Review

This book, despite its almost Shakespearean tragedy end, has left me with a great sense of wonder and ambition. It was a dizzying read, the stories intertwining with a dynamic fervor which made them compelling from start to finish. The book is almost a piece of fine engineering, with every person and event functioning as a cog in the Hollywood machine. Biskind traces the seismic cultural shifts with great care, never fabricating a false boundary between two eras but rather focusing on the push-and-pull fluctuations in the industry. Biskind’s writing style was a revelation in itself. He does not incessantly interject his own opinions, yet he retains a distinct voice through his masterful juxtaposition of interviews, overlapping story structure and highly particular details. The entire book feels less like a report and more like a careful reconstruction of late 60’s and 70’s Hollywood. His narration style seemed to match the times he was writing about. In the first two chapters, I could almost hear the drawl. In subsequent chapters, it became more direct, more city-like, in the last chapters he sounds reflective and drained. I am left with the feeling that I was there somehow, perhaps in a dream.

Beyond Biskin’s exquisite delivery, this book has made me confront my romanticized notion of the ‘auteur’, a notion that I had held onto since high school. Easy Riders Raging Bulls definitely acknowledges the genius of its subjects but it also exposes that same genius at times of crisis, uncertainty, and failure. Before, I thought that genius was unshakable. I had this vague idea that directors like Coppola or Scorcese were born knowing how to frame a shot. The movie industry has always been alluring to me, but until I read this book, it was shrouded in a thick mysticism. The most shocking thing was not reading about the sex or the drugs. It was reading about Spielberg wanting to quit Jaws and Coppola being lukewarm about making The Godfather. It was reading about how studio executives routinely branded films catastrophes before the release, films that became hits and have now become icons. Naive as it may be, I have always thought that ‘genius’ guaranteed an assurance. I have chastised myself endlessly for my creative indecisiveness, because I thought that it was the same as talentlessness. The book ends questioning their true claim to ‘auteurism’, revealing the blurred line between ‘art’ and ‘branding’.

Throughout the book, I found myself identifying with Ashby’s ideas of the ‘human condition’, Lucas’ stoic stubbornness, Coppola’s fragile ego. I realized that in that director’s chair was a person with qualities that I could admire as well as qualities I could dislike. It made me interrogate the icons that I had and re-evaluate the pedestals on which I placed Hollywood royalty. However, this was not due to disappointment, they were still utterly fascinating, just less God-like and by the end, completely stripped of their patron sainthood. Peter Bogdanovich’s story acts as a cautionary tale. He serves as an example of a man with great potential who, like Narcissus, was paralyzed by his own admiration of himself. Coppola, who starts off as a visionary, ends up resembling King Lear.

As strange as it may be, the book has empowered me to pursue my interests in relation to the film industry. It has given me a dose of reality that, despite its pitfalls, makes the industry more tangible. The idea of failure or criticism scares me far less than it used to. The deconstructed idea of the ‘genius’ and ‘auteur’ makes me far less intimidated. The constant flux in which the industry seems to be makes it all the more interesting. Networking is, of course, essential, but that’s the same in almost every other industry. Looking back on the ‘cast of characters’, they are all very different people, united by ambition, determination and desire. There is no mold, but there are risks.

That being said, there is one running theme through all the interviewed subjects that I relate to greatly: the way in which they stylize their lives. Biskin addresses the directors’ propensity to live out their movies. This is apparent throughout the entire book, the way they talk about themselves and their peers is extremely cinematic in itself. I was about halfway through the book when I realized that this is exactly the way in which I think about my own experiences. The genres varied from Friedkin’s scandalous bluntness to Spielberg’s introspective nostalgia, but I got the clear sense that they were carving out characters and throwing out one-liners. They were simultaneously watching and describing the film of their lives.

Although the book ends with the downfall of the New Hollywood movement, I do not think the blame is solely on its undertakers. The film industry is notorious for its alternating phases, always chasing and shaping culture in tandem. From my perspective, it was all inevitable, but it is better to burn out than to never come close to fire at all.
