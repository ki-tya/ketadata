Introduction

The topic we are exploring is recreational drug use in the year 2030. While this may seem somewhat controversial, the drug market is undeniably lucrative. Illicit drugs are produced and sold all the time, and there is no reason to believe that that will change anytime soon. The moral dilemma remains however. Public policy has made the production and sale of recreational substances illegal in an attempt to protect the population from causing harm to themselves but this approach causes a myriad of knock-on effects whose morality should be taken into consideration as well, perhaps on a more practical rather than idealistic level. The drug trade in its current form is exploitative: the people who harvest and produce drugs remain largely under-represented and underpaid for their labor. Furthermore, the money accumulates in the hands of criminals and contributes to spiking rates of violence, causing unnecessary instability in vulnerable areas. While drug ‘experiences’ in the public consciousness are constituted by vague images of shamans and psychedelics, much more attention is paid to the addictive and potentially life-ruining aspects of substance use. All of this is occurring against the backdrop of the rising prevalence of the pharmaceutical industry, with prescription drugs gaining a solid foothold in most of the western world as a necessity for psychological well-being. What the moral question comes down to is whether people have the right to access mind-altering substances and considering the fact that alcohol is legal, drugs are prescribed and illicit drugs are bought and sold despite their illegal status it seems that conducting any form of a ‘war on drugs’ is a futile exercise in going against the tide of inevitability and causing a fair amount of harm in the process.

In this paper, we examine the viability of a future business opportunity in the recreational drug sector. First, there is the PESTEL analysis which is then followed by the construction of a matrix based on the most important factors of the former. Within these dimensions, there is the description of two possible scenarios of the state of drugs in 2030. Finally, our business opportunity is developed and adapted to these scenarios in the last part of the paper.

PESTEL Analysis

Political and Legal  

Question 1: Will governmental regulations on recreational drug use be lessened by 2030, seen from a healthcare perspective?  

The Netherlands currently tolerates the sale of soft drugs in coffee shops. However, coffee shops are obliged to follow strict rules, the usage of hard drugs is suppressed and cannabis-growing operations are penalized (Ministerie van Justitie en Veiligheid, 2019). According to Burke (2016), legalization leads to more marijuana-related traffic deaths, increase in the usage of marijuana and increase in hospital visits caused by drugs. These arguments will cause regulations to be even more tight in the future. However, more and more arguments are found in favour of the decriminalisation of drug possession. The United Kingdom’s Health and Social Care Committee published a report in 2019, stating that its current criminal justice approach is failing (UK Parliament, 2019). Instead, they should opt for decriminalisation of drug possession for personal use. As a consequence, money is saved from the criminal justice system and allows for more investment in prevention and treatment. Seen from a healthcare perspective, governmental regulations can move in both ways. However, strengthening the laws has not really had an impact in the past, so it is more likely that regulations will be lessened in the future. Since this is quite uncertain, an uncertainty factor of 3 is given. The impact of government regulations has a great impact, since this will influence whether opportunities in the recreational drugs secor are legal at all. This is why an impact factor of 5 is given.

Question 2: Will governmental regulations on recreational drug use be lessened by 2030, seen from a drug- related violence perspective?  

Besides the healthcare arguments, drug-related violence arguments can be used to estimate future regulations. An argument used for decriminalizing personal drug use is the increase in drug-related violence caused by the criminalization: according to the Mexican government, 34,000 people have been killed in drug related murders from 2006-2010 in Mexico (Open Society Foundations, 2019). According to Gavrilova et al. (2015), decriminalization of the production and distribution of drugs may lead to a drop in violence. Since the chances are high that drug-related violence will decrease when the industry is decriminalized, it’s likely that government regulations will be less tight in 2030. Hence, an uncertainty factor of 2 is given. As already mentioned above, government regulations have a great impact on the feasibility of an opportunity in the recreational drugs sector. This is why an impact factor of 5 is given.

Economic  
Economically, the future of recreational drugs is at an intersection of several unfurling timelines. Firstly, there is the question of decriminalization vs legalization which remains a tricky matter.

Question 1: Will recreational products be taxed and regulated?  

If the government legalized and regulated substances, then they would be subject to tax, bound to standardized quality measures and possibly price fixed yet big businesses would still remain at an advantage (O’Brien 2020). However, the more common route has been decriminalization which has shown various degrees of market freedom in practice, yet does not allow for the full scope of legalization (Cussen and Block 2003). The amount of drugs legalized could expand the market and cause a financial boom (The Economist 2019) which could stimulate national economies. The uncertainty factor, therefore, is 4 since there is no singular protocol that we can defer to while the impact score is 5 due to the entire structural integrity of the drug business depending on this aspect.

Question 2: Will there be trade implications for legalized countries?  

Furthermore, there is the question of establishing legitimate trade of drug-related goods. The black drug market has always been global, there is no reason to believe that a legal one would not follow suit.The trade implications could vary country by country based on the level of legalization and regulation. A legitimate drug trade has the potential to be highly influential, considering the scale and scope of the drug market across the globe. Therefore the uncertainty factor is 4 and the impact factor is 4 as well since this would be an important yet secondary aspect of the integration of the drug market.

Social  
Question 1: Will it be socially stigmatized to consume recreational drugs?  

Socially, the stigma surrounding the use of drugs is lessening, with clearer categorizations of substances and their effects coming into view, due to the increase in knowledge and access to information on the subject. Since Generation X, the mentality around drugs has been steadily evolving. There is stark contrast to the way heroin is perceived in comparison with Ayahusca, for example. The distinction can be drawn between substances which are highly physically and/or mentally addictive and substances which facilitate ‘experiences’ (Hajizadeh 2016). There is also a trend towards perceiving mind-altering substances as psychologically or spiritually significant, with proponents such as Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Lab selling a New Age drug-supplemented idea of wellness to upper-middle class western liberals. Beyond the confirmed health benefits of marijuana and the benefits of micro-dosing drugs such as MDMA or LSD which are currently being tested, the widespread use of pharmaceutical amphetamines also begs the question of whether recreational stimulants should be considered in their own rite. The uncertainty factor assigned to this aspect is 3 while the impact score is 5 due to the profound effect social stigma would have on the recreational drug market.

Technological  
Question 1: Will there be developments in the making of recreational drugs?  

Technologically, it is likely that there will be the development of new designer drugs as well as new methods at mitigating the adverse side effects of drugs such as mental/physical addiction, flashbacks, allergic reactions and hangovers (or ‘comedowns). Also, it is likely that technological developments could bring current drugs to a more realized version of themselves, amplifying the desired effects and/or adjusting the time and intensity of the substances (Koerth-Baker 2016). If addiction could be effectively treated through medical technologies, then the recreational aspect of substances could be highlighted in a more positive light. It is plausible that new methods for ‘getting high’ will emerge such as wearable technology (The Guardian 2015) of AI experiences. Due to the constant updating of technology the uncertainty factor is 2 while the impact factor is 5.

Environmental  
Question 1: Will government regulations imposed on drug-waste increase or decrease in the future?  

In the Netherlands, countless garbage sites are found resulting from the production of drugs (Schaart, 2019). In the last two years, the amount of waste has increased dramatically, partly caused by the fact that the production of 1 kilogram of synthetic drugs results in 18-24 kilos of waste. Producers came up with various creative ways of disposing this: in manure (leading to drugs found in corn) or throwing it out from a driving car. These actions bring along multiple problems for people, animals, and the environment. Moreover, there are economic consequences involved: removing the waste and processing it costs ten thousands of euros. When the government increases the punishments on dumping the chemical waste and tracks down more producers, an opportunity in the recreational drugs sector will be difficult. However, an opportunity for a government organisation which gets rid of the waste is possible. When the regulations on drug usage and production will be reduced, more opportunities arise concerning the processing of waste for the private sector. The impact on the environment is strongly correlated with the amount of regulations posed on the producers. This is why it’s uncertain how the situation will be in 2030 and a 3 is assigned. The environmental factor is quite important since the production of drugs has a big impact on the environment. Moreover, it has a great influence on the possible opportunities in this sector. An impact factor of 4 is therefore assigned.

Dimensions

The two dimensions we chose to create the scenarios are the level of legalization of the markets and the level of social stigma present in society. We chose these two dimensions since they will have the biggest impact on possible future opportunities. Moreover, we expect that both dimensions will change in the future which makes the creation of the scenarios more interesting. Currently, the sale of soft drugs in coffee shops is legal in the Netherlands. The consequences of the criminalization of hard drugs are causing problems for society: increasing violence and waste nuisance (Gavrilova, 2015; Schaart, 2019). Since the current approach of controlling drug usage comes along with many disadvantages, we expect that more kinds of drugs will be legalized in the future. This broadens our horizon for an opportunity in the recreational drug sector.

The second dimension is based on the level of social stigma present in society. Social stigma is defined as criticism posed on a person based on social characteristics due to which he or she is distinguished from other members of a society (Frost, 2011). Social stigma will influence the amount of people using drugs: users will be ashamed of using drugs when their environment opposes the usage of drugs. We expect that the social stigma regarding recreational drug use will decrease in the future: more and more people are using it and there is an increase in the knowledge regarding drugs. As with the legalization of the markets, the level of social stigma has an influence on the possible opportunities in recreational drug use.

Legalizations of the markets Social Stigma (Armstrong, 2019) (Khan, 2020)

Scenarios

Quadrant 1

In this scenario, the reality of legalized markets works to fuel a social intolerance of ‘recreational’ drug users. With law enforcement no longer wielding the power to curb the production and consumption of drugs it is relegated to the social sphere where it must fight its battle in the court of public opinion. On the surface, there is the social shaming of ‘drug’ users: addiction statistics are constantly amplified through the media, people cannot speak openly about their drug experiences without risking being severely ridiculed, and the entire industry is demonized as a catalyst for the degradation of society.

Pharmaceutical companies, in order to maintain their iron grip on the drug market, fund copious amounts of research into the negative effects of prolonged drug use, thereby saturating the discourse with uncharitable representations of drug users and scaremongering to more conservative segments of the population. Due to psychological and psychiatric disciplines becoming the arbiters of ‘public good’, there is a sharp distinction drawn between ‘prescription’ and ‘recreational’ drugs. Ascending to an almost religious fundamentalism, the psychoactive substances prescribed by professionals enjoy a level of respectability among society due to their claim of being ‘essential’ for the well-being of select individuals, a way for them to be productive members of society. The ‘recreational’ drug user, on the other hand, is made to feel deficient and problematic, unworthy of acceptance or integration due to them ‘throwing their life away’ or some other incarnation of this adage.

There are also structural means that ensure the ‘recreational’ drug user’s status as a pariah, such as mandatory drug-testing by private entities or institutions. In the same way that tattoos were seen as the markings of social outcasts which were all but guarantees of life-long unemployment and marginalization, so is the use of drugs, at least public sphere, seen as a sign of inadequacy and inability to participate fully in the shared social reality, a fact which is constantly reiterated through the media and echoed within family and friend circles. Although drug businesses are also vilified, it is the individual users which stand to lose the most in this scenario.

Quadrant 3

This scenario is an extension of the current state of affairs in which drug use is accepted as a social reality yet the markets remain non-legal and unregulated. The drug market, while expanding to meet the demands of users, is a global force for inequality. The trafficking and sale of drugs is dependent on the exploitation of poorer countries with the resources to harvest and produce the drugs to then be sold elsewhere. While the drug market remains lucrative for those at the top, it breeds high levels of criminality and violence between competing parties.

As a result of public policy driving the entire market underground means that law enforcement is responsible for controlling the circulation of drugs. This amplifies social inequality and bias, with marginalized groups being searched and arrested at higher rates than more privileged ones and leading to disproportionately severe consequences. While the use of drugs is continuously romanticized and glorified in popular culture and celebrities flaunt their life-changing psychedelic trips on social media, prisons become increasingly crowded with non-violent drug-offenders and livelihoods can be ruined at the drop of a hat if one is found to be in possession or in the business of drugs. Thus, the drug market as such mainly profits criminal entities (economically) and the bourgeoisie (socially) while leaving others exposed and vulnerable to both state-mandated and localized violence.

Beyond this, the drug market is neither taxed or regulated meaning that the circulation of money completely avoids official channels and governments cannot effectively capitalize on the industry. Without a regulating body, the quality of the drugs sold is also cause for concern since there are no protocols or standards in place for checking the purity and safety of the substances.

Opportunity

The opportunity that we found in the recreational drug use sector is a drug advocacy firm. The main goal of this firm is to advertise in favor of legalization of drug use and thereby influence political, economic and social institutions. The business idea will be explained further by analyzing the components of the business model, based on Afuah’s categories (Afuah, 2014). Afterwards, the opportunity will be adapted to the two scenarios.

Customer Value Proposition

Our customers are the group of people we represent. These people are buyers and users of recreational drugs. Our value to these customers is that we represent them, and promote the use of recreational drugs. We place these drugs into a positive light: we show the fun of using drugs, we explain what they exactly do and that the right way of using it would not necessarily harm your body. Our customers benefit from this since we will diminish the social stigma that is present. This will have a positive influence on our customers: they are more free to use the drugs and will receive less judgements. Moreover, when we show the positive sides of the free use of drugs, politicians might be influenced which in turn can result in the change of the level of legalization of the markets. What’s compelling about our firm is that the customers individually won’t have an impact on the social stigma or on the level of legalization. As a firm, together with our customers, we have a much broader impact on society.

Market segment

As mentioned before, our customers are the buyers and users of recreational drugs. More specifically, they are buyers and users who think that society needs to change. They believe that the usage of drugs is not a bad thing; when you use it in moderation, it can add pleasure to your lifestyle. Our customers are people who realise that too much is never good, and they are aware that drugs can have negative influences. However, they think that legalizing drugs benefits society as a whole: less violence, less chemical waste, and freedom of activities. Our customers will be between the 18 and 40 years old; we assume that this is the age group who actively strives to change society. Since our target group is quite young, we expect that they are not willing to pay large amounts of contribution each month. According to Jellinek (2018), 20,9% of the 18+ dutch population has at least smoked a joint once. This means that one fifth of the mature dutch population is somewhat interested in recreational drug use. Hence, we expect a quite large group of members. Since we are the only ones performing these activities (in the Netherlands), we do not need to take into account competitors directly. Moreover, a cooperation with a firm which performs the same activities as us is a way better idea than to compete with this firm: together we have a much larger impact on society than just by ourselves. We intend to provide our customers with articles and research concerning economic, political and social developments in the drugs sector. Therefore, we need to have high quality suppliers of these articles.

Revenue model

Our revenue models are advertising and subscriptions. We intend to work with memberships. To become a member of our association, the customers need to pay 10 euros each month. As a return, our members receive monthly newspapers with an update of our actions and developments related to drug usage. Moreover, they will receive articles with political, economic and social findings in the drug sector and articles with drug recommendations or recommendations for certain coffee shops. We can include different kinds of memberships: when you want more articles, a higher price will be asked. Furthermore, we will also gain revenues by advertising: coffee shop owners can place an advertisement for their shop in our newspaper. Moreover, everyone is free to donate money. With this money we are able continue our campaigns and other activities. Our pricing-model will be posted pricing: the price of a membership is communicated in advance.

Growth model

Firstly, our firm will grow by creating brand awareness. We strive to get attention in the media, are active on social media and promote our activities in newspapers. This will result in more and more people getting to know us. Moreover, our activities will be spread by word of mouth in the recreational drug use community. People who are already a member will share their experiences: they will share what we do as a firm, but also the interesting findings in our articles to their friends in the same sector. This will result in more members and gifts. Moreover, when more people read our newspapers, the demand for placing advertisements in our newspapers will increase. Due to this we are able to ask a higher price for a place in our newspaper. Our strategy to maintain revenues will be a team up strategy: we will cooperate with competitors to address as many customers as possible and to have the largest possible effect on society. In the end, our competitors have the same goals as we have. The most effective way of cooperation would be an acquisition since it is useful to maintain one single business name to create brand awareness.

Our main costs we need to focus on are the costs of acquiring news articles and academic research for our newsletters. Moreover, the costs of our advertising campaigns need to be kept low. Besides, the loans of our employees need to be paid, just as the rent/mortgage of our office. We carry a differentiation- driven business model, since we are the only one providing these services, so keeping our costs low is of lower priority than with a cost-driven business model.

Capabilities

The main resources we possess as a firm are our brand awareness, our direct members, our relationships with the suppliers of news articles and researches, and the community formed with our members. With these resources we are able to provide our members with high quality newspapers and articles, and are able to influence society with our advertising campaigns.

Adaptation to the scenarios

This opportunity is robust in both scenarios. In quadrant 1, where the markets are legalized, but there is a high level of social stigma, the firm will mainly focus on addressing social movements and ideology. In quadrant 3 where there is no social stigma, but the markets are not legalized, the firm will mainly focus on political institutions. The memberships are possible in both scenarios. Moreover, the offering of the news articles is also possible in both scenarios, since the distribution of findings about recreational drug use is legal. Acquiring more members will be more difficult in a society with high social stigma. However, this will in turn increase the feeling of a community formed, which will increase our memberships on the other hand. When there is no social stigma, many people are likely to join our community; they won’t feel any shame. When the markets are legalized, many people might be interested in our articles. They are able acquire knowledge which they can apply in real life. When markets are not legalized, our articles are still interesting since not many people have experiences with certain drugs. In conclusion, our opportunity is robust in both scenarios.
