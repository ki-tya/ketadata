**AESTHETICS AND POLITICS**

**Introduction**

The term ‘drag’ refers to the act of cross-dressing. However, this definition does not account for the cultural status which this practice currently maintains. Drag has been a part of various cultures throughout the history of civilization. In recent history, drag has risen to prominence along with the discourses of sexuality, gender and identity. Drag, in its current form, began in New York’s queer underground club scene through a structured system of ‘balls’ and ‘pageants’ in which contestants would construct elaborate looks and present themselves to be judged by a panel of judges. Beyond these events, the participants organized a structure of drag ‘houses’, similar to the concept of fashion houses. Due to the fact that a large proportion of these individuals were destitute due to being disowned by their families or ostracized by society at large, these communities developed a family-like structure with more experienced members taking displaced youths under their wing. The culture of drag then entered mainstream consciousness through cult films such as _‘Paris is Burning’_(1990), a documentary about the ball scene; _‘Priscilla Queen of the Desert_’(1994), a film depicting the lifestyle of three professional drag performers; and _‘Pink Flamingoes_’(1972), a John Waters film starring Divine who rose to cult status after its release. More recently, _‘Rupaul’s Drag Race’_, a reality competition television series, reared the culture of drag into the spotlight, cementing drag as an artistic practice in its own right. In the age of postmodernism, drag has offered a conception of performance and identity that is radical, multifaceted and nuanced within its commitment to the aesthetic expression of life. 

  

  

**Reality and the Self**

Kant’s idea of the moral autonomy of art relies on the transcendence of the human mind by separating it from the entity in which it resides (Mcmahon 2011, p. 157). It suspends art in time and space, positioning the object as a causal force for the contemplation of the eternal. Despite its romantic appeal, a disinterested mode of contemplation is an impossibility because humans, by virtue of their own subjectivity, can only ever be self-interested. The ‘self’ is a byproduct of the ‘point of view’ (Bourdieu 1995) and all that is perceived becomes embedded in the narrative fabric of the subject’s life, whether consciously or unconsciously. 

However, the self is also being negotiated along with reality yet the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult as a result of the accelerating development of modern society. The overabundance of imagery has brought to light the extent of reality’s fragmentation, making the belief in one collective and shared human experience difficult to justify. The Information Age triggered a collective identity crisis the effects of which can be seen across all representational forms. The history of mankind can be viewed as a series of ruptures, each fundamentally restructuring the order of ‘the real’. Yet, this narrative hinges on the existence of a ‘real’ that is symbolically formulated through a synthesis of its subjective perceptions

Our understanding of reality is inextricable from the symbols with which we use to represent it. All structural mechanisms which affect the qualitative experience of life  rely on this capacity to negotiate ‘the real’ through signifiers which are themselves subject to change through the very same systems which they create. The history of civilization is a history of the constant construction and reconstruction of that which we refer to as reality. In this sense, all progress inadvertently results in fragmentation, a splitting of reality that is necessary for any expansion within the paradigm of creation and destruction. Thus, representation must kill in order to create.

While some religious institutions were some of the first and most historically significant patrons of fine art, others were fervent in their rejection of ‘the image’. Iconoclasts feared the “murderous capacity of images” (Baudrillard 1994, p. 3), they saw images as “murderers of the real; murderers of their own model” (Baudrillard 1994, p. 3).In this sense, nothing real could ever be truly represented and any attempt was a treasonous fraud. Iconoclastic rage at the murder of divinity is not simply a matter of religious faith. The concept of divinity applies to God insofar as the concept of God applies to the self, the ‘soul’ as an ideal object aims to imbue consciousness with a reflexive sense of sanctity and meaning. Representation irrevocably calls this faith into question: the idea of being ‘made in God’s image’ becomes increasingly incoherent with every new representation. This is the paradox which fuels the tension between art and life. Iconography murders that which it depicts, representation makes tangible that which cannot be tangible: presence. 

However, it is impossible to exist within a social sphere without the symbolic power of images. Presence without representation is too expansive to be intelligible. As in Plato’s cave, reality must be mediated in order to be perceived, we can only see the shadow which life casts upon a surface, a shadow which can be manipulated. Plato’s allegory resigns humanity to perpetual captivity, a fate of observing the shadows but never looking directly into the light (Plato 2019 p 99). But whilst it may truly be impossible to make direct contact with the “realm of pure form”, the aesthetic regime of art creates the possibility of mobility along its axis. The aesthetic regime of art, according to Ranciere (2010), is re-configurable into various emplotments within which art and life exchange their qualities (p. 119). In the schema of art becoming life, art is “a form of self-education” (p. 119). To the extent that it pertains to the construct of the self, this emplotment directs us to the transformation of life in art’s image.  Thus, the only way to close the gap between representation and presence is to embody the iconography directly. It is only in the ongoing process of becoming that one truly exists. The self is constantly escaping its own consummation and yet in art it finds a realm of infinite branching forms of existence, both materially and conceptually. 

Drag is the art of presence. It is the embodiment of a persona and a waiver of one’s own autonomy for the sake of verisimilitude. It is the becoming of one’s own iconography through the use of the body as an aesthetic medium. It is the acceptance of the fragmentation of the self and the employment of this fragmentation as a creative force for the induction of ‘characters’ directly into ‘the real’ without the mythology necessary for fiction. It is the framing of the self that is completely in accordance with an artistic vision of life. 

**Authenticity** 

Drag, as an art form, has staked out its own position within the discourse of authenticity by simultaneously functioning as the culmination and the refutation of the authentic self. The self has historically been seen as a (human) condition rather than a self-contained creation. The ‘authentic self’, within the modern discourse, is to be found and expressed, a directive which has relied more on self-acceptance than anything else (Varga 2014). This has positioned the self as a concrete reality which already exists in anticipation of its realization. 

Drag rejects this notion. In its praxis, the true self is not that which you are but rather it is that which you desire to be. The self is defined by its aesthetic reality rather than its internal one. The sentiment of “we are all born naked and the rest is drag”, a maxim reiterated by Rupaul, reads like a peppier version of Sartre’s “existence precedes essence”.    

The concept of ‘the realness’ as an aesthetic criteria is a fundamental part of drag culture. This strive towards verisimilitude aims to recreate the external manifestations of a certain lifestyle or character. Effectively, drag becomes a simulation of man’s infinite play. The impetus is to create and live out a fantasy of a certain type of presence without needing to support the claim with any lived experience or evidence. It is the embodiment of a lifes solely through formal elements, it is the elevation of the aesthetic as the ultimate truth and a fabrication of implied narratives. 

  

**Autonomy**

The historical avant-garde underestimated the endurance of art as an autonomous institution through the temptation of aesthetics. Avant-gardist movements, which attempted to challenge the autonomy of art (Burger 1984), inadvertently strengthened the very institution which they set out to destroy. Their lasting legacy is not that of bringing art to the people, rather they became a catalyst for the expansion of art’s autonomy from ‘the beautiful’ to ‘the absurd’. 

Avant-garde art tested the flexibility of the institution and as a result established the inefficacy of art as it’s crowning glory, the meaninglessness and futility of existence finally found its refuge in the elevation of form. The radicalism of Duchamp’s ‘Fountain’ does not simply rest on the tantalizing sight of a urinal in an ‘art institution’. It is a provocation that extends far beyond the object’s physical presence and time, binding all urinals thereafter to the discourse of beauty and taste. 

If according to Schiller “Man is only completely human when he plays”(Ranciere 2010, p. 115), then any object he comes into contact with can be viewed as a prop. The ‘pure gaze’ sought after by the Fluxus movement (Dezeuze 2006, p. 145) is not necessarily the gaze of a passive observer, it can also be the gaze of the actor. Therefore, the question is not, in Brecht’s terms, what differentiates a chair in a museum from its functional counterparts; the question is who does one become when that distinction no longer exists. 

This ‘infinite play’ (Ranciere 2010, p. 115) is what allows drag queens to create entities that are emergent yet separate from themselves, a dual dynamic particularly apparent in audience perception. The type of fame enjoyed by drag queens is quite unique, they are known almost exclusively as a ‘persona’, neither real nor fictional. The name by which their fans refer to them is not the name of the artist behind the makeup, it is the name of the character which they have brought into existence. Their persona becomes a public figure while the artist remains a private citizen. This is not due to any particular secrecy about their non-drag identity. _‘Rupaul’s Drag Race’_ presents the contestants out of drag for the majority of any given episode. The confessionals and the challenges in the workroom show each queen in their ‘boy form’, shots of the group getting ready to go on the main stage deconstruct the transformation by showing the process itself. And yet, despite the suspension of all mystique, the illusion does not lose its effect. That is because it is not a trick, it is a reality. 

Through this presentation of an alternative self drag queens simultaneously posit an alternative reality in which their persona exists. It is the induced reconstruction of ‘the real’ to accommodate a life that was not born but built. It is transient iconography which encompasses the tension between presence and representation, it is art and artist as an inseparable whole. It is through this loophole that drag queens maintain both of the realities within which they exist. 

Despite the performative aspects of drag, such as lipsyncing, it cannot be directly tied to the tradition of performance art because what a drag queen does is secondary to how a drag queen is. Marina Abramovic’s work, for instance, shows a clear distinction between art and artist. The body is used purely as a medium, often suppressing signs of her internal states in order for the viewer/participant to confront a corporeal reality before anything else. In a drag performance, the artist is always present. It is an extension of Goffman’s dramaturgical presentation of self pushed to it’s logical extreme (Smith 2019, p. 12). It is neither real nor false. The emplotment of the life of art resides within them as they are constricted by the limitations of their physical body (Ranciere 2010, p. 122). The vision is never fully complete yet it is constantly in a state of flux by virtue of their real-time existence. Through the constant yet concealed presence of their person they split their own timeline, allowing their persona to emerge as an autonomous being that is simultaneously an expression of their internal world and an independent entity which they do not have full control over.

  

**Politics of Drag**

Whilst drag does not necessarily imply any political agenda, it has nevertheless become a refuge for queer individuals and people of color who feel ostracized by the society in which they live. Drag exists somewhere between disillusionment and desire, appealing to both sides of the spectrum by acting as either a magnifying glass to society or as a hedonistic indulgence in the aesthetics of opulence. 

Drag intersects multiple political axes without committing to any of them explicitly. However, drag maintains a particular political potency due to its inherent link to identity, its creation of a new personal simultaneously creates a political counterbalance. The existence of drag as an art form is in itself a challenge to the gender and class politics. It has reconstituted feminine aesthetics outside of the male gaze, thereby establishing their autonomy beyond the politics of desirability. It has managed to alienate the patriarchal elite by recreating the facade of what they desire without the relation to a corresponding reality. This strive for ‘realness’ has also manifested as a gateway to class consciousness with the exploration of what it means to have money on an external level. However, much like the historical avant-garde, it’s political potential is tied to the chaotic and heterogenous character of its practice rather than any concrete political agenda. It is a rebellion against prescriptive identity. In the realm of drag, the body acts as both the starting point and the medium for the expression of an internal, aspirational reality. The idea of ‘living the fantasy’ is in many ways similar to the ‘ongoing utopian project’ undertaken by the historical avant garde. 

  

  

**Conclusion**

**D**rag encompasses within it the constant oscillation between ‘art becoming life’ and ‘life becoming art’ (Ranciere 2010 p. 119). It is a generative art of presence that fundamentally reimagines the singularity of ‘the self’. It is the aesthetic creation of an independent entity that exists in the world on its own terms. The external and internal inform each other and through this inextricable link, the drag persona acts as a missionary for reality’s colonization of the imaginary, creating an emergent ‘reality’ of the artistic order, like the birth of Athena from Zeus’ forehead.
