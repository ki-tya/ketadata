The Dramatic Imaginary of Trisha Paytas
---



1. Introduction

YouTube has fundamentally changed the way in which audiovisual content is produced and consumed online, in many ways foreshadowing the modern age of streaming services. There is a radical simplicity in the collective call to ‘broadcast yourself’ - it sounds direct while remaining perfectly vague. There is no further specification on what constitutes ‘yourself’, the implication being that the user has the opportunity to define, and perhaps discover, themselves through their use of the medium.

These pre-conditions have led YouTube to become an expansive and incredibly diverse ecosystem of content with communities steadily forming around specific channels or types of videos. YouTube has gone through many different phases, but as users became more accustomed to the platform, formal experimentation became a fundamental principle in its development, along with an ever-evolving algorithmic logic which has not only created new forms of entertainment but also new types of audiences (Simoensen 2011).

YouTube, despite its relative newness, already has its own history as a medium as well as a community. In this sense, political interrogations of the YouTube algorithm fall short due to their bind to the external ‘real world’ which prevents them from engaging with the YouTube environment wholly.

This research approaches YouTube as an artistic and televisual medium (Valck 2014); an ever-growing catalogue of content produced within a paradigmatic duality of old and new: on the one hand, making use of formal and conventional elements established by artistic traditions which preceded it and, on the other, establishing YouTube-native conventions which have emerged as a result of its medium-specificity. .

The exchanging of properties between art and life has a longstanding discursive tradition in aesthetic theory. Ranciere, informed by Schiller’s framework of the aesthetic regime, conceptualized several emplotments such as ‘life becoming art’ and ‘art becoming life’ (Ranciere 2010) which have been applied to various unconventional artistic practices, the historical avant-garde being the most notorious (Burger 1984). The theory posits that the ongoing internal conflict between life and art is an essential condition for their existence. Ranciere goes on to discuss Dionysian theatre as an early form of moral self-education which was effective to this end because of the theatrical principles of unity (time, action, space). Beyond these core concepts, which have remained an essential logic in the narrative arts, dramatic devices such as soliloquies and monologues acquire a new life when applied to the formal conventions of YouTube videos. However, while the theory of drama proves to be useful in this endeavor, it is impossible to bypass the two fundamental differences. Namely, the camera’s gaze and the screen separating us from the physical reality of the situation. In order to truly attempt to draw a connection between amateur user- produced online video content and the ‘moving arts’, both film and television theory must be employed in order to accommodate for a wider definition of artistic form (Patterson 2018).

After all, YouTube is not cinema, or theatre or even television. But it is something similar, far more similar than one might initially expect.

Beyond theories of art, this type of enquiry has had precedents in new media studies which have traced online ‘storytelling’ as a direct descendant of its earliest forms (Dorothy 2004), drawing on both contentual and formal analysis to establish, with great precision, that which is new and that which has always been (Cuy 2009). There have also been formal exploration of YouTube-specific genres such as the ‘unboxing video’ or ‘asmr’ (Nicoll 2018). There has even been an in-depth analysis of a YouTuber’s personal genre, an analysis written by Roland Betancourt about the work of Grace Helbig (2016), and although our approach implies a fundamental disagreement on YouTube’s artistic potential, there is plenty to be gleaned from academic attempts to modernize theory.

The object which we are focusing on is Trisha Paytas’ YouTube presence and more specifically, on the videos which fall into a particular dramatic genre which she herself established. In the context of this research, this genre is referred to as ‘Kitchen Floor’ videos. To give a quick overview: in June 2016, Paytas uploaded a video entitled ‘crying on my kitchen floor (again)’, a title which referred to three prior videos of her, literally, crying on her kitchen floor, the first of which was posted in March of that year. The title and thumbnail of the video went on to become a meme, gaining its own cultural significance outside of the platform which by extension heightened its symbolic status on the platform as well. Through Trisha Paytas’ own acknowledgement of a particular style of video, a style which was quite a departure from the content she was known for producing at the time, christened a new genre of video which has since been replicated hundreds of times by Trisha herself and steadily ingraining itself progressively deeper into YouTube’s community conscious.

Trisha Paytas herself is notable as a vehicle for the exploration of YouTube genres for several reasons. Firstly, Paytas’ has gone through many metamorphoses in her career, both on YouTube and mainstream media, with appearances ranging from The X Factor and TLC’s My Strange Addiction to her featured role in an Eminem music video, which means that the genre obtains its distinction, not only based on its internal qualities, but also through its stark contrast with Paytas’ other content. Secondly, Trisha Paytas, despite her relatively low subscriber count in comparison with the biggest creators on the platform, has joined a handful of YouTubers who have managed to transcend their YouTube fame by becoming full- fledged cultural figures — a feat which was in large part achieved through the ‘Kitchen Floor’ genre. Finally, Paytas has been forthcoming about her desire for fame and celebrity from a young age and has also stated that her major influences include Anna Nicole Smith and Andy Kaufmann; the former as a symbol of an aspirational lifestyle and the latter is as a major influence in Paytas’ work. Kaufmann was an American ‘entertainer’ and ‘performance artist’ with a very particular style and affect aimed at destabilizing his audience through constant shifting between absurdity and sincerity. This is significant because it attributes Paytas’ work with artistic intentionality, the degree of which is unknown but also largely irrelevant. By her own admission, the content which she produces for YouTube has an artistic purposiveness, justifying its use as the basis for an exploration of YouTube drama and dramaturgy.

2. Question

The question at the core of this research is to what extent can it be argued that Trisha Paytas’ ‘kitchen floor’ videos have established a YouTube-native dramatic genre as well as the extent to which her dramatic persona acquires meaning through the co- construction of narrative within the algorithmically determined networks which inevitably structure the over-arching historical narrative of the platform itself. It is therefore pertinent to examine the ways her ‘dramatic acts’ are embedded within a larger community narrative and how formal and thematic conventions emerge in this type of digital environment. In this sense, the recommendation networks are the narrative ‘continuations’ and ‘developments’ within a larger schema. This marks a significant departure from traditional ideas of narrative, namely because it is determined, in large part, by its own audience and their viewing practices without any imposition of external, theoretical or structural conventions. The algorithmic narrative allows for a constant multiplicity of meaning-making by acquiring new meanings with ever reconfiguration It also fundamentally diverges from traditional narrative in terms of its loose temporal structure; lacking a definitive beginning or end and constantly subject to change, meaning that it is never truly stable nor finished. Despite these discrepancies, the ‘algorithmic’ narrative’s claim does not rest on its formal conventions but rather emerges as a result of the audience’s perceptual experience and interpretation of it as such.

It is necessary to study the shifts in the concepts and classifications of content on YouTube because it does not merely act as a means of distribution — it also constructs its context. Therefore, unlike more filmic texts which can be analyzed through their internal structure, YouTube videos do not lend themselves to separation into singular textual units because their structure always extends beyond the video itself, thereby making its networked position an essential part of its overall meaning.

3. Method

Our methodology included a preparatory stage which consisted of a playlist search query matching [Trisha Paytas Kitchen Floor] in order to conduct a cursory overview of the ways in which these videos have been anthologized through the semantic associations which they evoke in the audience. These observations were employed to formulate a hermeneutic definition of ‘Kitchen Floor’ as a genre which was then operationalized as the selection criteria for a master playlist containing all ‘KF-type’ videos uploaded by Paytas between March 2016 and present day (Dec 2019).

The core of our methodological approach is based on Airoldi et al’s extensive investigation of music genres on YouTube. However, due to the fundamental differences between the musical and audiovisual disciplines, adjustment had to be made. The research is split into three stages: a network and semantic analysis of Trisha Paytas’ narrative and dramatic practices, a recommendation network of associated channels which include other YouTuber’s names in the titles which embed her within a larger YouTube universe and a network of meta-narrative content about Paytas’ herself which further canonizes her as one of the strongest dramatic characters in YouTube’s history. Each step is based on the content analyzed in the previous one with the seeding sample for Paytas’ KF genre coming from an intentionally curated playlist the analysis of which directly contributing to the seeding sample of 15 videos from said playlist which contain names of other prominent figures on the platform in order to construct the association network based on their recommended videos. Furthermore, the final step, which utilizes the search query [Trisha Paytas Drama] to scrape data from content ‘about’ Paytas, goes a long way in contextualizing the associations previously established. All three stages are visualized in Gephi, while the first step is further supplemented through semantic visualizations based on recurring video titles within the KF genre in order to fully grasp the recurring stylistic elements which Paytas employs.

4. Analysis

The first network, which consisted of the 206 videos representative of the KF genre, did not include recommended videos but rather focused on the interrelations between the videos themselves. After the application of Gephi’s ‘community detection’ algorithm, the data set was sub-divided into five clusters, four of which showed significant overlap. However, upon examination of video titles in each separate cluster, it was quite clear that the groupings were neither semantic or thematic in nature. After multiple attempts to determine the organizational logics of these associations, it was the ‘publishedat’ filter which showed the highest correlation with the clusters, a theory which is further supported by the fact that the cluster furthest away from the rest corresponded to the most recent set of videos.

While the videos are not thematically distinguished in terms of the metadata used to determine modularity, the video titles (fig 2) show clear semantic distinctions between the topical themes of the videos. It is also noteworthy that the capitalization patterns are representative of a particularity that is significant in determining the overall presentation of the video, the majority of Trisha’s KF videos are either titled completely in lowercase or capitals and alternates between the two styles in a seemingly random fashion, all of which subtly yet quite concretely demonstrates the emotional charge and instability present in the content itself.

The recommendation network (fig 3) based on the seeding sample of 15 videos from themaster playlist was not aimed at finding related videos. On the contrary, the network was specifically conceived in order to create a network of associated YouTube personas in order to examine the algorithmically determined social structure which contextualizes users by way of their demographically determined cliques. The videos used for the sample all contained another YouTuber’s name in the title. The connotations were mostly negative or antagonistic, but not exclusively. At a crawl depth of 1, the network yielded 331 nodes which were then filtered down to 31 using a degree range of 62 — 195 (fig 4). The set contained four modular clusters which were very succinct in showing Trisha Paytas position on YouTube. The majority of the related users already had a strong sociocultural association with her, such as public ‘beefs’ or genuine friendships. However, the list is nevertheless quite polarized in terms of the ‘dramas’ which she has had in her past, indicating that those events have not yet lost their cultural relevance.

Finally, the meta-narrative network which employed the search query [Trisha Paytas Drama], and a crawl depth of 0, and subsequently yielded (100) nodes and (582) edges. This set had a higher modality(0.434) than the other two which resulted in clear cut clusters of a diverse set of channels from across the platform, who have uploaded a video discussing Trisha Paytas’ drama whilst operating on the same medium (fig 5).

5. Discussion
![[Pasted image 20251107023320.png]]

It may seem that these findings are not particularly significant. However, they are far more compelling when observed through the formal elements of the content which it’s represents. Firstly, it is important to know that the ‘Kitchen Floor’ videos used as the primary data set in this research all ascribe to a nearly identical technical set-up consisting of a fixed angle, location, lighting, etc. Furthermore, the content of these videos, while varying in topic and tone, always provide an emotional spectacle which is rarely expressed as dramatically and intensely in real life, much less on social media platforms. The semantic map of the content only goes so far in expressing the viewing experience, in the same way that a film description does not evoke the same response as the film itself.

Furthermore, the extent to which the network of associations represents actual conflicts (Jason Nash, David Dobrik, Gabbie Hanna, H3H3, etc) which occurred almost exclusively on the YouTube platform, employing multi-gaze storytelling for heightened feelings of attachment and immersion (Rühlemann 2019) further confirm the algorithmic encouragement to watch the ‘drama’ unfold signifies that it is a significant pattern repeated by the audience time and time again. In this context, Paytas emerges as the archetypical dramatic anti-hero, distinguished by an antagonistic drive and the unrelenting need to demonstrate ‘the reality of the problem to the audience through the dramatic act’ (White 2013).

The third network which demonstrates the amount of meta-narrative content made about Trisha Paytas and the turbulent emotional cycles of her online presence which further demonstrates the culture of ‘drama’ which is scattered throughout the YouTube platform. Entire channels are dedicated to seeking out ‘dramatic’ content and describing it in miniscule detail while also sharing personal opinions on the matter. In this sense, the distinction between life and art is continuously amplified and obscured. Objectifying Trisha Paytas’ and her life events for the entertainment of others thereby conceptualizing her as a ‘character’ while simultaneously acknowledging her as someone they could potentially know through the implied proximity of the YouTube space.

Trisha Paytas has often been criticized for being too explicit and open online, however this criticism posits that the boundaries of public and private are more or less the same on YouTube as they are in ‘real life’. While there are social media platforms which are intended to be an extension of an individual’s social presences, YouTube is not one of them. By virtue of its audiovisual nature it is an extension of the same dilemma which has persisted since the invention of the camera: its unparalleled ability to represent the formal elements of reality while simultaneously casting an unnatural mechanical gaze on the subject, thereby invoking performance (“Notes on The Gaze.” 2019). The question of whether Paytas’ displays of emotions are authentic is irrelevant because in terms of the viewing relationship facilitated on YouTube, it is not the objective internal state which determines its verisimilitude but rather the performance of an internal state to a camera lens before making the decision to share it on a platform (Varga 2013).

Therefore, Paytas’ choices to share the Kitchen Floor videos constitutes an intentionality and commitment towards maintaining the persona on this platform, with the implied awareness of the algorithmic processes which structure the audience’s perceptions through the recommendation system. In many ways the KF genre and the algorithm within which it is constituted reflects the audience’s fascination with emotional instability and conflict because even without the formal embellishments of theatre, television or film, they are still driven to consume it for personal entertainment, even when it is presented realistically, because the screen which separates them from each other also prevents the full engagement of their emotional state.

6. Conclusion

The findings of the report provide deeper insight into the phenomenon of Drama on YouTube. As previously mentioned, YouTube as a platform mediates the distribution of the user-uploaded content (Cunningham 2013). However, the algorithmic logics which guide the organization of that content also establish it as the setting of dramatic events. Due to the inter-relational nature ‘dramatic’ acts transcend beyond the individual into a community forum structured by algorithmic forces which aim to appease the audience’s need for emotional excitement.

Our research does not argue that YouTube is necessarily an artistic medium, only that it has the potential to be explored as such. We acknowledge the pluralistic nature of the platform as one of its distinguishing qualities, one which has allowed for an unprecedented diversity of content and community. YouTube is in the constant process of co-construction, meaning that while the algorithm exerts influence over its users it is simultaneously being influenced by them in return. While this research focused on established dramatic traditions, there seems to be a growing need for research that is focused on the fundamental restructuring of human patterns of self- expression online.

8. Reflection

Kat Golubev reflection:

1. A)  I was responsible for all the usual stuff I’m responsible for but honestly I have been so
    
    sufficiently humbled by this project that I’m not even in the mood to discuss it.
    
2. B)  The group dynamics were better the second time around, but maybe that’s because I was
    
    less stressed about the dynamics and more stressed about data sets.
    
3. C)  Honestly, it wasn’t bad and if it ain’t broke why fix it.
    

Luka Putarek reflection:  
A) I was responsible for the data analysis, technical part of the project, I Aimed to figure out the software while Kat was doing the literature analysis and writing the majority of the paper. We updated ashore on the progress, I showed Kat the ins and outs of the software and She came up with the theoretical framework for our report.

B) This time, we knew each other’s strengths and limitations, and like on previous project group dynamics was positive and productive, I had no problems with my partner and we could agree on anything.

C) Kat is a writer and I’m tech support, and that dynamics worked for both of us. No notes on improvement. The software was infuriating to figure out but that’s beside the point.
