The Composition of Music: A Tale of Two Interfaces
---


1. Introduction

By giving the elusive temporality of music a spatial context and representation, interface reconstitutes music’s cultural form within itself. Of course, music could not exist without a listener, a role that has been radically transformed in the digital environment; no longer restricted to the ‘other side of the radio’, the affordances of streaming services reinvent the modern listener as the ‘user’.

Taking a broader historical view, music has been a constant throughout the development of modern civilization in various forms (Frank 2008), yet it is only in the digital incarnations of these cultural forms that their qualities can be compared directly. Alan Kay’s concept of the meta-medium, as described by Lev Manovich, posits a medium which encompasses within it both ‘already-existing’ and ‘not-yet-invented’ media (2013, p 108). As such, the digital divide between these forms of media shrinks due to the ubiquity of software and allows us to compare previously disparate cultural phenomenon with each-other. After all, it is remarkable that two of the dominant arbiters of music in modern times were built to address different problems, house different databases and have different market appeals all while existing, and holding their ground, within the same digital climate.

2. Question

The question which we are examining is the extent to which the interfaces of Spotify and SoundCloud differ in their normative concepts of music as a cultural form and how the ‘ideal user’, as constructed through each site’s affordances, reflects these conceptual differences.

The comparative aspect of this research serves to emphasize the plurality of ‘music  
cultures’ (Ferm Almqvist 2018) which can, through software, coexist within the same medium. This allows us to examine how the various characteristics of these cultures are determined and operationalized through their interfaces.

The relevance of this research is therefore twofold: on the one hand examining the current cultural landscape in terms of the norms enforced and reflected through software and, on the other, tracing a lineage between streaming services and the technologies that preceded them and contextualizing affordances through their analogous counterparts.

3. Method

Cultural forms are not static, they are constantly in the process of their own development through an ongoing synthesis of the human subject and objective forms (Simmel 1997) . Thus, discursive interface analysis provides a flexible framework within which to analyze music as formulated and reformulated by software with the intent to qualitatively compare the ‘ideal users’ on two of the biggest music platforms of the modern age (Stanfill 2015).

The aim is to examine the ‘ideal user’ as constituted through the affordances of Spotify and Soundcloud along three axes: time/space, individual/collective, and active/passive. These axes are not mutually exclusive, meaning they are not employed in order to categorize separate affordances. Rather, they function to demarcate aspects of music as a cultural form through the user’s level of engagement and provide qualitative measures of this user-engagement through which to analyze the divergent sensory, cognitive and functional affordances of Spotify and SoundCloud’s interfaces.

4. Analysis

Space/Time

Although the relation of time and space can be applied to examine anything, it nevertheless determines the paradigm within which the user engages with the content thereby making the development of an ‘ideal user’ possible in the first place. Music is a temporal form which has historically been framed through different apparatuses and social contexts (Stambaugh 1964). As such, the listener’s experience of music, both qualitatively and functionally, depends on its mediated environment.

The mediated environments of Spotify and Soundcloud share many of the same functional affordances in terms of listening to music. Meaning that the interfaces have the same player functions (play, stop, next/previous track, volume slider) as well as “loop track”, “shuffle” and “queue” functions which allow users to make changes to preceding tracks (fig. 1.1 and 1.2).

![[Pasted image 20251107022219.png]]
Fig. 1.1
Fig. 1.2

These functions determine the extent of temporal control which a user can exert on

recorded material. Certain playback affordances are excluded. For example, whilst it is possible to watch youtube videos at a slower or faster speed, this function is not present on either streaming service. This attests to the importance of the temporal relationship that is mediated through them: the time which music takes up cannot be distorted without violating its authorship (Remneland Wikhamm 2016), an ingrained notion which both interfaces reinforce.

Beyond their functional affordances, Spotify and SoundCloud enforce very different representations of music which, in turn, determine the ways in which users relate and engage through the interface. These differences begin with the smallest unit of content, referred to as ‘song’ on Spotify and ‘track’ on SoundCloud. This cognitive affordance distinguishes the interfaces based on formality: the former invoking more traditional associations as a single part of a larger whole while the latter emphasizes its singularity through its focus on the production process. The sensory affordances also differ, with Spotify condensing each song to its linear temporality in the common tradition of digital music players and SoundCloud visualizing each track with a ‘waveform’ (Jen 2014) which corresponds to the track’s frequency (fig. 2).

![[Pasted image 20251107022256.png]]
Fig. 2

Through this sonic representation, SoundCloud’s interface makes music concrete in its digital form. The waveform constitutes a reversed causality in comparison to its analogous predecessors. Music has taken shape before: as prescriptive notation, i.e sheet music, as well as in other material forms such as the ridges on a vinyl. However, both of these forms played determining roles in the music’s eventual sound. SoundCloud’s waveform, alternately, is rooted in more artistic and interpretive visual representations of music such as Kandinsky’s abstract paintings or Microsoft’s music visualizer which has spawned countless variations on its original software (Candy 2018). Yet, by restricting their own artistic license, SoundCloud does not create an artistic form but rather a semantic system through which a track can be read but not reproduced. By using the height of the individual bars as signifiers, SoundCloud renders each track with an objectivity which ushers its users to a heightened awareness of music’s formal properties.

![[Pasted image 20251107022328.png]]

On a larger scale, the personal temporal relationship between the users and the music is also configured in different ways. Spotify’s organization of content consists mostly of grid layouts, with songs, albums and playlists  
represented by their cover art with the title and artist displayed  
underneath (fig. 3). This aesthetic is a form of skeuomorphism as it  
is reminiscent of record and CD store inventories without any  
direct relation to their material qualities. The emphasis on cover art  
imbues the music with a sense of timelessness: the legacies of  
great artists are presented in the form of their chronological  
discographies, each image marking a separate stage in their career.  
The cognitive affordance of Spotify as a personal music ‘library’  
also invokes a sense of significance in its users through the implied  
collection of content over a stretch of time, lending itself easily to  
nostalgic impulses (Fleicher 2016). SoundCloud, on the other hand, promotes a far more immediate link between time and music through its timeline structure, forcing the user to scroll back in order to find tracks they shared in the past, an inconvenience which enforces the platform’s urge to constantly listen to new music rather than revisit the old.


Individual/Collective

Beyond the spatiotemporal environments constructed through their varying sensory and cognitive affordances, Spotify and SoundCloud’s interfaces also differ in terms of the social dynamics which they normalize. Spotify maintains an individualistic spirit: through the interface’s functional affordances as well as the cultural value which it has acquired, the user is encouraged to make public playlists (fig. 4) in order to participate in a curation of one’s own tastes with the ability to tinker with the title, the cover image and the song order. Due to this being the only kind of content-sharing on the platform itself, i.e not as an embedded file on a different social media site, the practice acquires a performative aspect of self-representation through musical taste and overall aesthetic. Spotify reflects the user back to themselves by linking its organizational and social properties, creating an impetus to contribute to the commons by creating the digital equivalents of mixtapes that can be accessed through the user’s account or by playlist name through the search function.
![[Pasted image 20251107022416.png]]

SoundCloud is oriented towards a far more collective engagement with music. Users can like, share and repost tracks on their own profiles making it beneficial for users to follow others with similar music tastes in order to be updated on what they are listening to, effectively fostering branching genre- dedicated communities (Hubbles 2017). These metrics are clearly visible under every track, giving the user a clear idea of any given track’s relevance  
on the site (fig. 5). The only comparable metric which Spotify shares is ‘plays’ which are  
accessible only by hovering over a tiny icon displayed on the far-right corner of each track. ![[Pasted image 20251107022453.png]]

Fig. 5

SoundCloud’s most notable social features, which are wholly absent from Spotify, allow users to like and comment under specific parts of a track’s waveform (fig. 6), facilitating an experience of listening that is focused on collective presence similarly to a live musical performance. The closest thing to this affordance on Spotify’s interface is the ‘Friend Activity’ column (fig. 7) which gives vague and incomplete updates on what people in your social circle are listening to, which is hardly useful considering the fact that most real-life friend groups are rarely based around a shared music taste, a separation that is increasing felt because Spotify does not encourage following other users to the same extent that SoundCloud does (Fleicher 2017).

Active/Passive

The axis of passivity and activity illustrates the starkest contrast between Spotify and SoundCloud. Firstly, Spotify is downloadable as a desktop app, meaning that it is more convenient to access and requires less motivation and urgency from its users unlike SoundCloud, which appears on desktop exclusively as a site. Furthermore, the sensory affordances of the two streaming services vary in the respective ‘moods’ which they bring forth in their users. Spotify’s default ‘dark mode’ with white letters is less distracting in a listening setting allowing the user to immerse themselves in the interface or ignore it completely. SoundCloud’s white background, on the other hand, does not afford the comfort of darkness, assuming that its users are deliberate in their listening habits.

Fig. 7
![[Pasted image 20251107022628.png]]
When it comes to the affordance of searching for content, Spotify and SoundCloud take different approaches. SoundCloud’s search bar is at the top of the page, prominently in the middle, allowing for quick searching (fig. 8.), a feature that is notably smaller on Spotify. In addition, despite Spotify having an entire page dedicated to searching for content, it is labelled as ‘Browse’ (fig. 9.1), which implies a far more leisurely activity than ‘Search’, and is formatted in the exact same way as the rest of the sidebar. The content is categorized based on genre (pop, rock, metal), mood (wellness, chill,mood, focus...) and activity (workout, diner, travel, sleep) making it simple to fulfill any musical ‘craving’ the user might have (fig. 9.2).![[Pasted image 20251107022658.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251107022743.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251107022806.png]]

Spotify also has a ‘Made for You’ page (fig. 10) which synthesizes the user’s listening habits into mixes, recommendations and personal playlists. The emphasis is put on ‘For You’ as determined by Spotify’s algorithms, which maintain a respectable reputation among the users. On the other hand, SoundCloud focuses more on the active listener and as such has less content provided on its home page.  

However, this scarcity is compensated for by an interface that is better designed for actively engaging with the content.

![[Pasted image 20251107022829.png]]

This brings us to the biggest difference  
between SoundCloud and Spotify, which is  
SoundCloud’s functional affordance of uploading content directly onto its platform (fig 11). while Spotify requires a distribution license which can be obtained from record labels, and in recent times, third party providers. This is the fundamental distinguishing characteristic between the two streaming platforms: Spotify reinforces music as that which is produced by the music industry and SoundCloud establishes a view of music that is far more in line with the participatory ideals of Web 2.0 (Reed 2017).

5. Discussion

The majority of our discussion is covered in the previous section, therefore we are using this section to provide a brief overview of our research and add relevant ideas that could not be easily placed within any given category.

Overall, on the level of the interface’s construction of a listening environment, sensory and cognitive affordances play the most significant role in shaping the user’s conception of music. However, the social and interactive features are far more reliant on the differences in functional affordances of each interface. But, due to functional affordances being the most likely to change over time for the purposes of increased utility, we have found that the ‘productive power’ at the core of music streaming services retains its ideological agency through the sensory and cognitive affordances of the interface. SoundCloud has often been hailed as the social media platform for musicians and while it does offer the capacity to post self-produced content as we have seen there is far more to its interface than simply the affordance to upload your own music

That being said, the music industry has consistently adapted its products over time, re-releasing vinyls on tapes and CDs before converting them into sync-able digital files, as was necessitated and incentivized by their demand within established forms of distribution (Passman 2015). Spotify can be viewed as a direct descendent of these historical media in its digital form. Independent artists, however, had far less access to any forms of distribution whatsoever which is why SoundCloud marks a fundamental change, creating a centralized space for independently-produced music which almost exclusively operated through discrete and disparate events before. It is also important to note that this change did not occur in a vacuum: while technologies for music consumption were developing, so were technologies for music production.

As such, SoundCloud’s popularity is highly dependent on the increased access to means of production (music software) and a higher musical literacy among its users. All these processes, by virtue of their existence within the same meta-medium, are interrelated through their digital nature and distinguished only through their affordances. Software provides a common denominator through which different cultural niches and embedded ideologies are more easily compared and contrasted through the comparative analysis of interfaces.

6. Conclusion

Despite their shared low level functional affordances, Spotify and SoundCloud reflect and enforce entirely different norms upon their users in terms of their streaming environments, social engagement features and consumption/production dynamics. The ideal Spotify user is interested in catering to their own music tastes and organizing their musical libraries into smaller evocative units, i.e playlists, which can be shared as a representational aspect of the user’s personality and preferences. This user is simultaneously more individualistic and more passive, comfortably accepting their position of engaged listening for their own purposes while maintaining a distance between themselves and established musical artists. The ideal SoundCloud user, alternatively, is more intimately engaged with music on a track-by-track basis, always searching for and sharing new content within their community, as well as producing their own content which they upload to the site.

Thus, through the varying constitution of their ideal users, Spotify and SoundCloud posit two different concepts of music as a cultural form: the former being more traditional and the latter more radical. This cultural plurality of music, despite existing throughout history, has never been so clearly demonstrable as it is in a digital space: a ‘music scene’ divorced from geographical location. By employing discursive interface analysis we have been able to pinpoint essential differences between Spotify and SoundCloud’s affordances, examining the cultural norms enforced not only through functionality but also through the sensory and cognitive experience of the interface.

It is important to note that while there are many differences between the affordances of Spotify and Soundcloud, the platforms have also adopted many of each other’s properties over time. Spotify has lowered its bar of entry making it easier to upload music onto the platform. SoundCloud has, conversely, introduced playlists (Downs 2013), giving users more agency in organizing the content they engage with. Furthermore, the platform’s app interfaces have far less differences in their affordances in what seems to be a victory of utility over originality. Therefore, there is plenty of research to be done into the emergent cultural form of music within the entire software operated meta-medium with a view in determining invariant qualities of music through the affordances which remain constant on both streaming services.

8. Reflection

Luka Putarek

a) I was responsible for the “leg work” doing literal comparisons of the platforms, taking screenshots and figuring out what are the important aspects of the user interface and in which way do they support our research.

b) Group dynamics was positive and productive, I had no problems with my partner and we could agree on anything.

c) Like I said our communication was very good so I have no notes on improvement.

Kat Golubev

a) I was responsible for the things that I could not bear to trust anyone besides myself with i.e the general direction of the research, the structure, half of the written content, and the final edit. In all honesty, I expected to be responsible for more.  
b) I somewhat felt burdened with the additional responsibility of communicating with another person so as not to leave anyone as a doe in the metaphorical headlights. But I must acknowledge that this burden, whilst a bitter pill to swallow, forced me into being unusually over-prepared which meant that, by the time I started writing, I had the unfamiliar luxury of actually understanding what it is that I am talking about. Although I did miss the adrenaline rush of scrambling to produce a coherent piece of academic writing mere hours before a deadline, this was an interesting change of pace.

c) In my opinion, group research projects are a lost cause, we all know that perfection is a solitary endeavor. However, misery loves company. So while I was completely against the idea of group work, and still will not concede that I would not have been able to complete this report by myself, it really wasn’t that bad. I think the key to successful group work is a mix of clear communication and rock bottom expectations.
