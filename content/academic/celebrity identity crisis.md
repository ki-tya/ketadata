From tabloids to twitter: The celebrity Identity crisis

ABSTRACT

This report analyzes the ways in which the autobiographical capacity of Twitter has redefined the concept of ‘celebrity’ and shifted the dynamics of celebrity culture. Focusing on the shift towards presentational media, the effects of celebrity autobiographical acts on Twitter are contextualized through comparison with representational tabloid media and the differences in cultural dynamics are emphasized through the use of relevant case studies. The dynamics of celebrity culture are examined from a social, economic and political standpoint in order to formulate a comprehensive analysis of ‘celebrity’s’ position within mainstream culture. Celebrity studies have been overlooked in favor of more generalized analyses of social structuring, but Twitter’s radical dissolution of previously held distinctions between public and private is most clearly conceptualized through celebrity culture, although the effects will continue to spread to every individual Twitter user. Self-disclosure is examined as both marketing and performance, allowing celebrities to circumvent traditional media outlets in order to expand their reach.The phenomenon of micro-celebrity is spotlighted as a key shift within celebrity culture and the subsequent emergence of ‘fame’ as an active and competitive occupation.

Introduction

Celebrity, as opposed to stardom, is defined by the transcendence of fame beyond any particular industry and as such it relies on media mechanisms to support its established status. Celebrity culture, throughout its various iterations, has always had a complex relationship with society at large. Celebrity holds a social status due to the collective acknowledgment of its well- knowness. Within the capitalist market, its value as a consumer product heavily relies on its manufactured authenticity. It is simultaneously idolized and demonized; raised to the pedestal of ‘role model’ by some and condemned as a symbol of decadence by others.

This cultural fascination and the public’s ‘melodramatic imagination’ (Beer 2009) means that there is a continuous demand for celebrity content. Tabloids have been narrativizing celebrity lives since the 1910’s, often elevating them to Shakespearean tales of love and betrayal. However, with the rise of social media, celebrity culture has undergone various seismic shifts in a relatively short period of time.

Twitter, in particular, has emerged as a primary site of celebrity culture, radically changing the dynamics of fame in modern society. David P. Marshall, a leading voice in the field of celebrity studies, has argued that with the advent of social media platforms and the user’s own construction of themselves as a public persona, a task that has been traditionally performed by external entities, celebrity has shifted from representational media to presentational media. Twitter’s imperative to document oneself through episodic autobiographical acts determined by its audiovisual, textual, and interactive affordances  
has spurred on a cultural reformation that affects all social media users, but the effects are most apparent in the reorganization of celebrity culture.

The central aim of this report is to examine the ways in which Twitter’s autobiographical capacity has redefined ‘celebrity’ and changed the dynamics of celebrity culture. Thus, this report conducts a qualitative analysis of Twitter’s influence on the concept of ‘celebrity’ within the social, economic and moral domains. The shift from ‘narrative’ to ‘autobiographical’ acts, as defined as episodic acts which are not necessarily part of the larger narrative by Poletti and Rak (2014), is taken as the central cause and its effects on celebrity culture are illustrated through comparison with 2000’s tabloid culture and the role of the ‘melodramatic imagination’, with supporting case studies. Celebrity itself is analyzed in terms of ‘presence’ and ‘affect’, a methodology put forward by Marshall as a foundation for ‘Persona Studies’ (2014) and through Cirucci’s framework for analyzing social media through concepts traditionally employed in video game analysis (2013).

Until recently, celebrity studies’ insights into society-at-large have often been dismissed due to the idea of ‘celebrity culture’ as a top-down process rather than one that is embedded within all levels of society. However, with Twitter’s accessibility, engagement and immersion, modern ‘celebrity culture’ has to be considered as a participatory and fluid process while modern ‘celebrity’ has to be analyzed as both entity and object. The relationship between Twitter and ‘celebrity’ is a complex web of identity construction, production and consumption processes which require a more nuanced view of celebrity culture as a whole.

Main Body

A. CelebrityasEntity

Less than a decade ago, celebrities were predominantly cultural objects exploited for their life narratives by tabloids and paparazzi to satisfy the public’s craving for celebrity gossip.

A defining moment of this cultural era was the 2007 tabloid coverage of Britney Spears’ public breakdown. The paparazzi photos of Britney’s shaved head took the world by storm; the young singer transcended to a different level of infamy - stardom. This event was significant both in terms of its production and consumption, its deliberately staged and performative nature as well as the enormous media appetite for every ‘Britney Spears’ story that followed (Luckett 2010, 39). To this day, the still paparazzi images persist in the public imagination. A cultural iconography created by the tension between public and private, between performance and authenticity. Spears’ choice to deliberately publicize her internal anguish was an act of revolt (Luckett 2010) and its performative nature did not diminish the raw and strikingly religious affect of the act (Redmond, 2008).

In this case, the tabloid acts as intermediary between a celebrity’s affective power and the public, making the celebrity a cultural object which can be deified or deconstructed by the media which writes it into existence. Twitter, in theory, is the apotheosis of this representational and highly stylized version of celebrity. On Twitter, the self is co-constructed by the celebrity, public and platform; it creates the networked self and, by extension, the networked celebrity. This co-construction of the self/celebrity can be separated into four main aspects: performance, interaction, influence and imitation.

1. Performance

Celebrities can perform their life narratives directly to their fans through autobiographical acts such as selfies and tweets, within the framework of their personal account. Through self- disclosure, both personal and professional, celebrities have agency to editorialize and share their own lives, reclaiming their narratives from celebrity news outlets. Twitter is based around professional and personal self-disclosure (Kim and Song 2016). On this platform, performance of self-disclosure incorporates “affect, redaction, and deliberative improvisation” (Papacharissi 2012). In order to adapt and subvert Twitter’s confines of 140 characters, users have to partake in both print and oral traditions of storytelling, reimagining syntax and grammar in a way that displays digital literacy (Papacharissi 2012). The importance of this fluency is emphasized as a requirement for performing the networked self, as per Goffman’s concept of ‘front-end performance’ (Papacharissi 2012). Whilst Twitter and ‘celebrity’ share a ‘symbiotic relationship’, distinguishing it from the parasitic nature of tabloid news, it is one that remains unstable due to the ongoing negotiations between authenticity and performance, in terms of agency, incentive and ’premeditated acts’ in the public sphere (Bennett and Thomas 2014). According to Marshall, celebrity’s ability to fulfill its function in a late-capitalist society is predicated on their ‘affective power’ which is celebrity’s capacity “to embody emotional investment” (2014, 161) (Gibbs, 2002). This ‘affective power’ is Twitter’s life force and as a platform which is distinguished by “intimacy, immediacy and accessibility”, Twitter is a particularly well-suited site for the development of celebrity culture (Thomas, 2014).

2. Interaction

Twitter’s technological affordances such as hashtags, addressivity (mentions and replies), retweeting, and embedding or referencing external information can be subdivided into three media richness dimensions: contextual, interactive, and informational (Tanupabrungsun and Hemsley 2018). On Twitter, the networked celebrity is situated within its cultural context, through the use of linked media and internal dynamics of the platform itself. This ‘networked celebrity’ exists on the same plane as the fans, allowing them to directly interact through Twitter’s like, retweet and favorite affordances (Tanupabrungsun and Hemsley 2018). These affordances in combination with self-disclosure help facilitate parasocial relationships between celebrities and public which have been shown to positively affect experience of social presence on the platform. The concept of ‘presence’ is employed in accordance with Kwan Min Lee’s definition as “the psychological state in which virtual (para-authentic or artificial) objects are experienced as actual objects in either sensory or non-sensory ways” (2004, 37).

3. Influence

Twitter environments are inherently co-constructed by celebrities, followers and the platform itself (Tanupabrungsun and Hemsley, 2018). This makes the platform a ‘third space’ in which “celebrity acts as an architecture of participation” (Bennett and Thomas, 2014).Celebrity becomes the implicit goal due to Twitter’s framing metric of followers allowing for a quantifiable measure of ‘popularity’ and ‘fame’. The term ‘followers’ itself is an embedded vernacular in which the worth of publicity is ‘self perpetuating’ (Faina 2012). Twitter and the networked self become immersive and consequential in the real world. This ‘immersion’, as applied by Angela Cirucci to social media and gaming worlds which she conceptualizes as self-contained realities which can affect their user’s perceptions of the outside world (2013)

4. Imitation

However, beyond traditional celebrities, Twitter also facilitates the creation of ‘do-it-yourself celebrities’ which receive ‘relatively wide circulation’ through subcultural publics or viral exposure (Bennett and Thomas, 2014). This democratizing aspect of celebrity was not present at all during the reign of celebrity tabloids.

Initially, microcelebrity was conceptualized by Senft (2008) as a bottom-up process through which individuals employ celebrity customs of self-disclosure in order to build fame, placing celebrity status on a spectrum beyond the follower/celebrity dichotomy. Since then, ‘applied’ celebrity has entered mainstream culture as an “individuated group activity” (Usher 2018) defined by its use of “mass communications and staged authenticity to deliberately foster parasociality with audience members in order to maintain ‘self-as-brand’,and perpetuate consumerism as if liberation” (Usher 2018, 15).

B. Celebrity as Product

Cirucci (2013) posits Twitter as a platform that gamifies celebrity but whilst status within a video game is mostly of interest only to other active players, celebrity status can be used to reap social and financial benefits in the outside world.

As such, Twitter not only gamifies ‘celebrity’, it effectively corporatizes it. In order to adapt to the current economic structure, the constructed networked self has incorporated itself into the ‘branded persona’ (Hearn 2008). ‘Branded persona’, the conceptual ground on which the Jungian idea of persona and marketing strategy meet and interact, can be approached from three different aspects: as a state of being, as a form of labour and as a promotional vessel.

1. ‘Branded Persona’ as State of Being

The branded persona, as formulated by Alison Hearn (2008) , is a concept which fuses the “private self and instrumental associative object” (197) into one entity “as a central strategy in the negotiation of increasingly complex corporate environments” (197). This fusion, according to Hearn (2008), erodes “any meaningful distinction between notions of the self and capitalist processes of production and consumption”(197). ‘brand’, in this context, goes beyond the idea of commodity and becomes “an entire ‘virtual context’ for consumption” (Hearn 2008, 199).

Kim Kardashian West’s nude selfie, which sent shockwaves through the entire media landscape in March 2016, can be seen as an autobiographical act of personal self-disclosure, for which West was both praised and criticized for (Haysom 2016), but it can also be seen as a promotional act which further reinforces the cultural iconography of the ‘Kardashian body’ invoked to sell Kardashian products, such a perfume line with bottles modeled on molds of Kim Kardashian’s naked body, to consumers (Weinberg 2018). Constructed branded persona “work to colonize the lived experience of consumers in the interests of capital accumulation” (Hearn 2008, 200). It is therefore impossible to fully distinguish between professional and personal self- disclosure (Kim and Song 2016).

2. ‘Branded Persona’ as Form of Labour

Self-branding is directly related to the development of the attention economy. Beller, quoted by Hearn (2008), wrote, “not only do the denizens of capital labor to maintain ourselves as image, we labor in the image”.The ‘branded persona’ is “a distinct form of labour” (Hearn 2008, 198) which monetizes the affective power of celebrity. This is not exclusive to social media platforms. Affect, understood as an emotional and relational measure of intensity and influence, has consistently been “co-opted by the media” (Gibbs 2002).

At the height of Britney Spears’ fame, she made around 9 million dollars annually whilst the celebrity news outlets who capitalized on her stardom made 75 million dollars within the same timeframe (Mcdonald 2008) . By giving celebrities the ability to market and profit from their own branded persona, Twitter has not only socially incentivized (e.g. maintaining reputation and relevance) the formation of the networked self/celebrity through autobiographical acts but it has also monetarily incentivized the active construction of the branded persona.

The celebrity news industry, in order to reap the financial benefits of celebrity, employs reporters, photographers and editors to produce the content sold to consumers. The production of the branded persona is a type of creative labour as “work on the self is purposeful and outer- directed; self-production is heavily narrated, marked by the visual codes of the mainstream culture industry, and subject to the extraction of value” (Hearn 2008, 197).

3. ‘Branded Persona’ as Promotional Vessel  
According to Gibbs (2002), “media function as amplifiers and modulators of affect which is transmitted by the human face and voice, and also by music and other forms of sound, and also by the image” (338). A tabloid contains various stories and segments featuring different celebrities, effectively employing a cross-promotional marketing strategy within the product itself. In the same way, celebrities cross-promote each other on Twitter by making use of affordances such as following, tagging, and retweeting (Bennett and Thomas 2014). Other traditional formats, such as the ‘celebrity interview’, also persist on the platform ( Usher 2015). Within these formats, celebrities can cherrypick what they respond to in order to maintain their construct of self whilst fans get the chance to be recognized by their idols (Usher 2015), a promotional strategy centered around the loyalty and engagement of their followers.

In many ways, the changes in the parasocial relationship between celebrities and fans can be seen as an effect of Twitter’s promotional culture. According to Wernick (1991), promotional culture exists as an expansion of the promotional message which is a “complex of significations which at once represents (moves in place of ), advocates (moves on behalf of ) and anticipates (moves ahead of ) the circulating entity . . . to which it refers” (182). A persona constructed and guided by promotional motives “positions itself as a site for the extraction of value” (Hearn 2008, 201) and “continually produces itself for competitive circulation” (Wernick, 1991: 192). The attention economy itself is predicated on inequality through which the quantifiable celebrity emerges (Marcus 2015). Therefore, despite cyber-utopian hopes, Twitter has “not radically democratized” (Marcus 2015, 46) because celebrity in itself is a concept which cannot be democratized.

C. Celebrity as Symbol  
Julie Wilson (2010) provides the necessary historical background of celebrity news, beginning in the 1910’s after the invention of the ‘movie star’ and continuously evolving throughout the years, dispersing into different genres and different target demographics, demonstrating the fluidity of celebrity culture. Virginia Heffernan’s (2007) detailed insight into the cultural appetite for unflattering paparazzi imagery and speculative journalism that was present in the late 2000’s, this demystification of the celebrity allure provides a sharp contrast to the publicist-controlled celebrity news prevalent during the Golden Age of Hollywood as well as the current interaction models between celebrities and fans. Yet, throughout the entire history of celebrity news, celebrities have consistently been used as cultural symbols within the moral and socio-political frameworks of their time.

1. Moral Symbol

A moralistic view of celebrity has been present since the inception of celebrity news. Academics labelled Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie ‘Female Chauvinist Pigs’ and critiqued their negative influence on feminism and impressionable youth (Kristiansson 2008). Tabloids employed Lindsay Lohan as a cautionary tale about the corruptive powers of fame and money. Her escapades, substance abuse and DUI’s were documented on the cover pages under sensationalist headlines (Earl 2017). The narrative of Lohan as ‘a promising young star gone wild’ juxtaposed with the stigmatization of her behavior, through ‘exposing’ and public shaming, was used to reinforce the hegemonic cultural norms and values under the guise of gossip (Earl 2017).

There have also been moral indictments on the controversial opinions voiced by celebrities before Twitter. A particularly vibrant example being Mel Gibson’s antisemitic rant which was recorded during a DUI arrest, a scandal which obliterated Gibson’s reputation and effectively banished him from Hollywood ("Gibson: 'I Am Not An Anti-Semite'" 2006).

Modern celebrity Twitter culture encourages the moral judgement of each individual user. When interconnected and emboldened by each other, Twitter ’mobs’ can be formed, uniting under the goal of ‘cancelling’ a public figure whom they find particularly ‘problematic’ (Wilson 2015). As such Twitter’s affordances have promoted a more moralistic public than tabloids, meaning that celebrity’s are judged for their ethics and sensibilities in the way they were openly judged for their looks during the tabloid era.

2. Socio-Political Symbol  
However, neither Lohan nor Gibson were seen as inherently political actors. On Twitter, however, political theater has merged with celebrity simultaneously causing the celebritisation of politics and the politicization of celebrity. Politicians employ the “three modes of ‘performed connectivity’: public, media and celebrity connectivity respectively” (Ekman 2014, 518). Public connectivity, through the publication of “staged personal relationships with public audiences” (519), blurs the boundary between politicians’ private and public lives.This performance exists on three levels of mediation: it is “staged in a public space; re-staged in a digital public space (Twitter); and disseminated to a wider public through news media” (Ekman 2014, 519). Media connectivity, which includes linking and redirecting to external sources of media attention creates an “infinite helix of self-mediation” (519) which, in turn, forms the basis for celebrity connectivity which, in the context of politics, is the publicized performance of “typical political rituals” (519) focused primarily on the “construction of symbolic values, reflected in the way politicians portray themselves as important and connected to (global)actors” (520). Through these modes of connectivity, the public’s attention is channeled away from actual politics and towards the politician’s personality, and as such, politics becomes inextricably tied to celebrity culture (Ekman 2014).

Currently, Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, is the second most followed account on Twitter and Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is the 13th, right below Kim Kardashian West (Boyd 2019). When examining these rankings, it becomes clear that politics has been thoroughly intertwined with fame, inevitably narrowing the gap between ‘influence’ and institutional power. ‘Clout’, a term that once applied to solely to an institutional form of authority, has become the signifier for ‘influence’ in all its forms (Gayomali 2017). This linguistic adaptation is demonstrative of its cultural underpinnings; the ‘influence’ of affective power and institutional power are joined together within the larger ecosystem of fame.

Furthermore, by making each user a potential commentator, Twitter becomes the site of cultural discourse which doubles as the court of public opinion. The number of followers in this case becomes a unit of amplification, determining the individual’s reach and influence. Kanye West’s tweets claiming that “Bill Cosby is innocent” or that slavery was a ‘choice’ have incited moral outrage on Twitter, with the core of the condemnation focused on West’s use of his expansive platform to spread ignorance and misinformation (Jones 2018), a deed that has become the closest thing to a Twitter ‘sin’.

Within the current media landscape, the public self is an inherently political one. The issues with this arise due to the increased difficulty of establishing normative distinctions between public and private entities, splitting publics into micro- and counter- publics (Marshall 2015). Joseph Faina (2012) posits Twitter as a platform, the ideology of which is defined by the drive for recognition and ‘instant publicity’. For Faina (2012), Twitter’s structure carries the potential of collapsing ‘spatial distinctions of public and private’ and moving towards a ‘hyperpublicity’ which does not have a referent public. As such, the influence yielded by celebrities would become an order of the ‘hyperreal’ (Baudrillard 1994), the notions of fame and publicity substituting for actual fame and publicity.

Conclusion

In his 1984 novel, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, Milan Kundera contemplates how internal desires for external acknowledgement structures an individual’s behavior and ‘sense of self’, writing:

“We all need someone to look at us, and we can be divided into four categories. The first category longs for the look of an infinite number of anonymous eyes, for the look of the public. Actors and singers fall into this category. The second category is made up of people who have a vital need to be looked at by many known eyes. They are the tireless hosts of cocktail parties and dinners. Then there is the third category, the category of people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love. And finally there is the fourth category, the rarest, the category of people who live in the imaginary eyes of those who are not present. They are the dreamers.” (Kundera 1984, 278)

Unlike the fame described by Kundera, digital fame does not consist of an infinite number of anonymous eyes but rather by a quantified number of followers each with their own individual account. This complicates the idea of a ‘public’, splitting it into an infinite number of mutually non-exclusive micropublics and counterpublics (Marshall 2015) thereby fragmenting ‘mainstream culture’.

The autobiographical self becomes a performance that is public, by metrics such as likes or retweets, while also being directed at everyone individually in terms of its relatability and relevance. As a result of Twitter’s affordances as a platform, networked celebrities also have the capability to interact with their followers, which, by creating a social presence experience, facilitates parasocial relationships between celebrities and fans.Twitter has become an immersive ‘third space’ in which celebrity status is inherently set as a primary goal by virtue of its platform affordances. Furthermore, along with quantifiable fame and popularity, the strength of a celebrity’s affective power and presence combine to form the ‘influence’ which celebrity can exert. Due to Twitter being an accessible platform without a ‘barrier of entry’, it becomes the site microcelebrity, which is the imitation of celebrity social media practices by ‘ordinary people’ in a bid to garner fame and celebrity status.Due to this, fame itself has ceased to be a thing bestowed upon an individual by mainstream media and has become an increasingly active and competitive occupation.This continuous competition to stay relevant has determined a great deal of Twitterspecific forms of self-disclosure and interaction.

Although Twitter seemingly gives celebrities unprecedented agency in their own narrative, many traditional aspects of celebrity culture have been incorporated into celebrity Twitter, such as employing the celebrity interview format in order to perform and market the self. Presence and affective power is commodified by the celebrities themselves and used to extract monetary value from the attention economy. The ‘branded persona’ is a constructed self- reflexive identity that is “singularly focused on ‘attracting attention and acquiring cultural and monetary value (Hearn 2008, 213). It is simultaneously a state of being the image itself, a form of labour which works to maintain the image and a promotional mechanism deployed in the current competitive corporate environment.

Celebrity maintains its position as a cultural symbol but due to Twitter’s blurred boundaries between public and private, a public self becomes inherently politicized. Moral outrage and political disagreement become increasingly difficult to distinguish from one another. Politicians themselves capitalize on the same modes of connectivity as celebrity, thereby making celebrity culture an essential part of political discourse. The concept of ‘clout’ has combined institutional authority with fame and influence which has created a socio-political nexus of celebrity.

In much the same way that the train changed the perception of space and time (Schivelbusch 1978), so has Twitter restructured the dynamics of celebrity culture and reimagined the cultural role of ‘celebrity’ itself. Celebrities are no longer easily categorized into deified role models or amoral cultural perversions, rather they become transient entities whose autobiographical acts are disseminated through presentational media and the quantifiable popularity which they garner facilitates extraction of monetary value and exertion of socio- political influence. Although Twitter carried a promise of democratization and freedom from established hegemony, the power dynamics between the celebrity, the publics, the platform and the industry are still inextricable aspects of celebrity culture. It seems as though celebrity is a fundamentally un-democratized phenomenon, relying on the inequality of distributed attention for its continued existence.
