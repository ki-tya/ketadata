Inside is a comedy special, written, directed, filmed, edited by, and starring American comedian Bo Burnham, which was released on Netflix on May 30, 2021 (fig 1.). The special, which was entirely filmed in the confines of a single-bedroom studio home during the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, quickly prompted a slew of reviews and think-pieces from major culture and lifestyle publications ranging from Vanity Fair to the New York Times, many of which hailed the work as the most definitive piece of content made about the current zeitgeist. The work, which can be described as the most ‘spectacular’ elevation of amateur digital forms ever attempted, is in equal parts a testament to Burnham’s genius and madness: a stark depiction of a man’s deteriorating mental health leading him towards increasingly poignant and virtuosic attempts at articulating the unspeakable. By “turning his cramped home into a faux cornucopia of spectacle” and imbuing the production with cinematic excess through lighting and cinematography, Burnham crafted a self-portrait of his exquisitely creative and troubled mind, a portrait which seems to have had profound emotional resonance in the culture-at-large. 

While this is by far Burnham’s most ambitious project, he has always been a singular and subversive voice in the contemporary comedy landscape. Garnering mainstream attention after videos of him, with his keyboard, performing provocative parody songs with razor-sharp wordplay, went viral on Youtube, Burnham has been widely considered a comedic prodigy since the age of 16. His subsequent stage act and specials continued to use “music as a vehicle for commentary”, with his comedy becoming progressively more dark and self-aware, at times even ‘tragic’. As time went on, Burnham became increasingly critical of the ‘internet’, the very medium responsible for his fame, and encouraged his audience to ‘log off’, stop performing, and live their lives authentically. This, however, coming from the performer on stage, was a blatant act of hypocrisy, making the comedian an even more paradoxical figure: openly desiring attention yet continuously questioning the rationale and ethical implications of such a desire. After the release of his 2016 special Make Happy, Burnham left comedy, revealing that he began having severe anxiety attacks while on stage.

During this hiatus, his career developed in other directions: Burnham’s widely acclaimed feature-length directorial debut Eighth Grade was released in 2018 and he once again re-appeared on the cultural radar for his supporting role in A Promising Young Woman (2020). However, the void which Burnham left in stand-up comedy was never truly filled: he continuously challenged the form and was the first respected comic of the ‘Internet Age’, recognized as an accomplished artist, performer and writer by some of the ‘greats’, an impressive feat when considering the hierarchical mentality which is prevalent among comedians. His return, in this sense, bears cultural and formal significance.

Inside is a difficult work to summarize. The special centres around expertly-shot musical theatre performances which are interspersed with recognizable digital forms of content and the more ‘authentic’, ‘backstage’ documentations of Burnham’s creative process, as well as confessionals (or ‘vlogs’) in which he speaks directly to the viewer. As Alison Herman notes, “for Burnham, Inside is less a new frontier than a return to form,” adding that, “the auteur has never been known for traditional stand-up”. While many have argued whether the special can even be considered ‘comedy’, it is apparent that the work transcends conventional genre classifications: some referring to it as a harrowing ‘musical fantasy about terrible realities’, others as a ‘claustrophobic masterpiece’, ‘one-man isolation theatre’ and ‘cinematic selfie’. While its lasting influence is yet to be determined, Inside undoubtedly constitutes a radical subversion of the comedic form, not only modernizing the comedy special but also elevating amateur forms of digitally-native content through the attempt to realize a singular artistic vision.

The question which this paper explores is whether the excruciating recursivity and unflinching self-awareness exhibited in Inside can be considered as a digital addition to the canon of ‘Theatre of Cruelty’ , focusing on the ways in which Burnham’s cinematic portrait of a troubled mind attempts to invoke the ‘Real’ through cinematic “aesthetics of the “psychological subjectivity of the individual” and, reflexively, the implications of the widespread affective resonance of such a singular vision of a “fracturing psyche”. In this sense, Artaud’s legacy acquires a dual significance: his theatrical and cinematic concepts are used as a framework through which to dissect the work, while his notion of the mad genius as a ‘victim of society’ is considered as a way to contextualize the piece within the current techno-capitalist culture. Burnham’s meticulous post-production of self and self-imposed limitations work in concert to capture the mind of a deeply troubled artist within four walls, the room functioning as a metaphorical skull inside which the frenzy of thoughts and feelings fight for dominance. As both spectator and performer, Burnham painstakingly attempts to use himself as a reference point through which he can "impel the mind by example to the source of its conflicts", continuously constructing and subverting an elaborate spectacle as a way to lead the viewer towards despair in its inherent meaninglessness, and, hopefully, to a tragic catharsis.

THE DIGITAL DOUBLE

"No image satisfies me unless it is at the same time knowledge" 

Antonin Artaud

Despite Artaud’s emphasis on the visceral and corporeal aspects of the ‘theatre of cruelty’, the transposition and adaptation of his theories to examine digital and cinematic forms have precedence. The Cinema of Cruelty is theorized as a mostly non-narrative cinema of excess in which complex issues are tackled dialectically, privileging the ‘logos’. While there has been debate about whether cruelty necessitates violence, the theories have also been applied to pop cultural forms and musical theatre in the 1960’s.However, Artaud’s writings on cinema were fairly meagre in comparison to his visions of theatre. Thus, the digital Theatre of Cruelty remains indebted to the concepts Artaud explored in the Theatre and its Double (1938).

While the Artaudian notion of the theatre’s double emerges as a “vision of a sacred, transformational and transcendental theatre” and relies on the metaphor to the extent that it implies the existence and realization of the ‘shadowed self’, in The Digital Double, Steven Dixon appropriates the concept to explore the use of digital technologies in a far less metaphorical sense. Dixon argues that discourses regarding cyberculture mark a return to Artaud’s dialectic, in which utopian virtual realities are “pitted against a dystopian skepticism, which attacks the soulless, alienated and schizoid nature of digital irreality ”. The screen thus allows for the emergence of the fragmented body, engendering a ‘double consciousness’ and ‘double gaze’. However, this disintegration of the unity of the physical body, could also be considered as a ‘death’, “enacting the subject’s annihilation, its nothingness”. 

Within this framework, Inside follows Burnham’s journey through a liminal space between two states of being: the performer and the spectator. This dichotomy is consistently re-established throughout the special as a central conflict, with Burnham using cinematic language and digital forms as a short-hand for internal states. These forms are often memetic or archetypal, a cyber-semiotic system of a kind of language-by-association.By looking at the imagery of the special through Dixon’s taxonomy of subject/double relationships, the fragmentation of Burnham’s ‘self’ and the patterns of his self-reflexivity begin to emerge.

The Double as Reflection

![[Pasted image 20251105111753.png]]

The notion of the double as reflection is most simply understood through the myth of Narcissus, considering both the Lacanian implications of the ‘mirror’ as well as the collapse of the boundary between object and subject. This motif is rampant throughout the special, most explicitly expressed through Burnham’s use of an actual mirror as a stand-in for the audience (fig 2), the repeated projections of his own image onto his body (fig 3) and the multiplication of screens allowing for a dialogic interaction with the self through a subversion of the ‘reaction video’ genre (fig 4).

Unlike Narcissus, however, Burnham rarely seems to like what he sees. Despite being captivated by himself, he can never resist the urge to be critical, in an admittedly futile of watching and the passive image of being.

The Double as Alter-Ego

attempt to absolve himself through self-awareness. Burnham is thus shown to be stuck in a continuous cycle of self-aggrandizement and self-depreciation, a circle of a familiar psychological hell which he invites the viewer to recognize as their own. The ‘screen’ itself, the materiality of the digital, is also an inextricable facet of these recurrent images. The mirror, in Burnham’s case, has two functions: it is employed as an additional degree of separation to bring attention to the ‘screen’ while also reflecting back his banal reality. While, the projections are, at times, self-aggrandizing, creating a larger than life image of Burnham which he can, ironically enough, only view from the small screen of the viewfinder, they are mostly a way for Burnham to confront and integrate his past selves through the symbolic order, coming into contact through the reflective act

The Double as Alter-Ego considers the self as a performative aspect, acting upon a different plane of ‘phantasy’. According to Dixon “the audience’s delight of recognition and differentiation between the live body and its mediatised double” can be traced back to one of the earliest examples of theatre which combined live and digital forms. Burnham presents the spectator with a different character for every musical number donning various ensembles and affects to fully ‘sell’ the performance before shattering the fantasy through the more confessional direct addresses, which are presumed to express Burnham’s ‘real’ self. However, one can never definitively know which incarnation represents his true self, which makes it difficult to pinpoint the ‘alter-ego’ per se. The most notable case of a presumed alter - ego, however, is shown during the ‘White Women’s Instagram’ sequence (fig.5), shot to resemble Instagram’s square aspect-ratio, in which Burnham de-genders himself to recreate pervasive visual tropes. 

![[Pasted image 20251105112013.png]]

While the set-up initially seems like a way to mock the women, Burnham recreates the tropes un-ironically, participating in the stylized escapist fantasy of the form and generating an alternative aesthetic reality of himself.

The Double as Spiritual Emanation

According to Dixon: “digital doubles representing spiritual emanations or incarnations of the body relate to notions of ghosts, astral bodies, out-of-body experiences, and soul projection.” While there are several times in which Burnham uses his own vocals as a ‘heavenly chorus’, the visual counterpart of this relation is mostly achieved through the use of lighting. Burnham uses searingly bright lights to denote spiritual awakening (fig. 6), he crucifies himself on a cross of light and uses the refraction of a disco-ball to project his headlight, a symbolic stream of consciousness emanating from his forehead, throughout the entire space (fig. 7 ). The spotlight which recurs throughout the special, also carries a spiritual meaning, as an uncompromising force which drives the spectacle, exposing and concealing the subject at will, the precondition of mechanical spectatorship (fig. 8) Through this connection, the spiritual and the technical are aligned through the camera’s most basic function of capturing light, always rendering Burnham either ‘in’ it or lost in the shadows.

The Double as Manipulable Mannequin

The final subject/double relation is the ‘manipulable mannequin’ which in Dixon’s survey is most often invoked through computer avatars or stand-ins for the body, a cross between ‘mythical being and digital deity’. Burnham takes a different approach by imagining his life as a monotonous video game which he himself is playing and live streaming for the first time.

![[Pasted image 20251105112211.png]]
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ki-tya/ketadata/main/content/images/embedded/bo%20burnham/Pasted%20image%2020251105%20112211.png)

By separating himself from his actions, Burnham comments on the game casually, confused by the double’s limited functions yet appreciative of the ‘graphic design’. However, this puts the spectator into a counter-intuitive position in which, through Burnham’s awkward movements on screen, they are confronted with the basic performative and behavioral aspect of daily life. Burnham’s tears in the videogame (press X to cry) precede a clip of him bursting into tears during a mirror confessional, further problematizing the extent to which either one of those performances could be considered ‘real’ as well as whether there is a fundamental difference between them at all.

THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF (DIGITAL) THEATRE

Despite the constant presence of Burnham’s ‘double’, he does not manage to transcend the paradox in which he has placed himself: he never goes ‘outside’, he never resolves the tension between his fragmented and alienated subjectivity and the external world. Artaud’s utopian vision can only be lived, because it remains impossible to perform. Thus, Burnham remains a ‘tragic hero’ faced with the impossibility and inevitable failure of his own endeavor. Yet, he is far from singular in this respect. According to Daniel R. Smith, the ‘expressive turn’ in digitised popular culture has had existential consequences for the notion of self and individuality in Western society. Online fame on platforms such as YouTube, according to Smith, has led individuals towards the recognition of their own inadequacy as a unified self, a breakdown which he likened to Hamlet’s moral conflict and termed the ‘tragedy of self’.

![[Pasted image 20251105112240.png]]

In Inside, this tragedy is taken as a central theme at the outset and becomes increasingly distressing as the spectator witnesses Burnham’s declining mental health. The impossibility of any real intimacy or connection is foregrounded through Burnham’s emphasis on the ‘screen’ itself, the unbreakable fourth wall. The tacticity of the Intermission scene in which Burnham cleans the ‘screen’, momentarily disappearing behind foam bubbles and reappearing once again (fig. 10), sets an insurmountable boundary between the subject and the spectator.

Despite this established distance, the special, in true Artaudian fashion, is nevertheless framed as a quest for catharsis. In Burnham’s own words, sitting behind a camera facing a mirror:

“I hope the special can do for you what it’s done for me these last couple of months, which is to distract me from wanting to put a bullet into my head, with a gun.”  It is a statement almost impossible to misinterpret.

Indeed, along with the discourse surrounding the work’s ambitious technical achievements, the discourse surrounding Burnham's grueling artistic process and mental state is equally prevalent. In a Vanity Fair review, Murphy emphatically states: “It’s raw and emotional, but it’s also a testament to the sheer power and force of ambition—the idea of torturing yourself to make “great art” instead of maybe protecting yourself and your mental health by, you know, logging off. “Brody notes that Burnham “deserves recognition for engaging in a mode of firsthand production more extreme—and extremely constrained—than what many filmmakers would dare”, while Rachel Syme writes : “at its core, “Inside” is an exploration of what it means to be a performer when you are stuck to a screen but also stuck inside your head.”

Rather than watching Burnham become more adjusted or fulfilled as a result of this undertaking, the special’s confessionals show Burnham’s mental state becoming progressively worse. As Burnham “weaves in footage of himself setting up shots, flubbing takes, staring into a laptop, breaking things in frustration, even bursting into tears”, the special becomes an “infinite sinkhole of discourse on discourse”. Burnham’s crisp cinematic sensibilities also work to distance the viewer, with Herman noting that while “on their own, these clips suggest honesty or vulnerability; together, carefully doled out between candid confessionals, they suggest trying to suggest honesty or vulnerability”. Despite Burnham spending over a year in isolation, in a constant state of ‘post-production of the self’, the audience’s desensitization towards emotionality due to the prevalence of ‘affective labour’ and ‘cognitive capitalism’, which have established negative affect and confession as a currency in themselves, make it impossible to distinguish Burnham’s ‘real’ displays of emotion from ones that are simulated. Thus the well-established ‘‘aesthetics of rawness’ render any transcendent sincerity hopelessly out of reach.

However, this ambiguity is also central to the special’s sustained tension. Burnham’s radical vulnerability is, first and foremost, self-serving. As Herman writes, ”Inside practically demands we ask what’s real and what’s not, what’s pure self-indulgence and what invention serves a purpose.” Burnham centres many ‘bits’ around his personal experiences of anxiety and depression, emphasizing particular aspects such as derealization and suicidal ideation. Yet, unlike many other mentally unstable ‘geniuses’ in the mainstream which cite their madness as a ‘gift’ or a source of creativity, Burnham squarely places the blame outside of himself, precluding the integration of his insanity as a necessary aspect of his character. Swaddled in a blanket and surrounded by camera equipment, Burnham laments:

“Maybe allowing giant digital media corporations to exploit the neuro-chemical drama of our children for profit, you know, maybe that was a bad call, by us. Maybe the flattening of the entire subjective human experience into a lifeless exchange of value that benefits nobody except for, you know, a handful of bug-eyed salamanders in Silicon Valley... Maybe that, as a way of life, forever... Maybe that’s not good.”

In Burnham’s eyes, the fragmentation of consciousness is a product of the times, engineered by elites who care far more about profit than the well-being of the human mind. As such, he sees nothing exceptional in his feelings of alienation, he is a ‘victim’ of a social order not by virtue of exclusion, but through its infiltration into the very core of his being. A social order in which he cannot help but participate.

CONCLUSION

In her discussion on the legacy of Artaud’s ‘theatre of cruelty’ and the cruelty of the subject’s performance, Helga Finter describes an incident at the Vieux Colombier, in which Artaud attempted to articulate the sources of his suffering through a three-hour ‘performance’ which included the scheduled recitation of three of his poems followed by an impromptu reading of his life story from a manuscript, until he could no longer find his place, before devolving into fully extemporaneous speech and eventually being forcibly removed from the stage. In a more concise yet nevertheless similar manner, Burnham presents not only the products of his internal anguish, but the anguish itself, and explicitly ‘calls out’ the conditions which he believes have sustained it.

Burnham’s constant use of the digital double mirrors his inability to reconcile his internal struggles as well as his desperate desire to articulate them. In doing so, Burnham transcends the form, but not the content. His attempt at evoking the ‘Real’ produces a hybrid form of digital content, using digital and cinematic forms as a language which is only apparent and accessible to a certain substratum of society, yet this formal specificity is precisely what accounts for its deep cultural resonance.

Burnham’s internal suffering, however, is never considered as valuable in itself. On the contrary, he presents his condition as completely devoid of any romantic value. He is propelled to create not by a mythology of a troubled mind but by the reality of it, and while it stands to reason that what he creates is reflective of his state, he never crosses the line into glorification. Burnham adamantly refuses to interpret his suffering as a virtue, using it as the unfortunate foundation upon which to build high spectacle productions of intense vulnerability. It is through these exaggerated forms and spectacles, that Burnham articulates the mundane agony of existence and ceremoniously leads the viewer back to the reality of their own fragmented and damaged psyche.
