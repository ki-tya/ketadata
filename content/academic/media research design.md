B. A first part of an argument

Twitter, as a platform, sets ‘celebrity’ status as the objective for its users. It is not based on the principle of mutual interaction but rather on the accumulation of ‘followers’. The term ‘followers’ itself is “embedded in the vernacular” of the platform and determines how users view themselves and each other (Faina, 2012). The number of ‘followers’ that one has determines their level of fame which, in turn, determines their status within Twitter’s ecosystem. Whilst ‘real world’ fame might guarantee a certain number of followers, established celebrities still need to produce Twitter content of a certain caliber in order to claim the status of a Twitter celebrity as well.

Celebrities construct their online Twitter identities through self disclosure, which can either be professional or personal in nature (Kim and Song, 2016). Professional self disclosure, opening up about their upcoming projects and such, was widely used during Twitter’s earlier years (Bennett and Thomas, 2014). Yet, over time, personal disclosure has become the expectant standard for celebrities on Twitter. This is due to fans have becoming increasing desensitized and accustomed to the presence of celebrities on this particular platform. Followers also have an apparent tendency to lose interest in celebrity accounts which only function to promote their owner’s commercial endeavors (Tanupabrungsun, 2018).

However, some celebrities still manage to successfully leverage their Twitter following into purchasing their advertised goods, most often through the use of engagement tactics, such as the celebrity interview (Usher, 2015). These tactics, Twitter Q&A sessions for example, are effective because, although a celebrity’s Twitter following might have become accustomed to their presence on the platform, fans still yearn for their icon’s recognition.

As such, the celebrity interview format of professional self disclosure manages to circumvent the predominant model of celebrity self disclosure under the guise of shining a spotlight on their followers instead of themselves. The motivations for these Q&A sessions are often framed as ‘giving back to the fans’ or ‘saying thank you to the fans’ (Usher, 2015). Fans, in turn, purposefully ask questions that they believe have the highest chance of being chosen by the celebrity in question and, more often than not, celebrities have shown to be eager to answer questions about their consumer goods and/or sponsorships (Usher, 2015). This plays into the followers’ desires of being noticed and recognized as a fan, rather than the desire to know the celebrity on a deeper, personal level which is often at play when it comes to personal self disclosure.
