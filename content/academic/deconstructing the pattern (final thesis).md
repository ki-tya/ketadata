ABSTRACT: Astrology has recently undergone a process of modernization, widely referred to as an ‘Astrological Renaissance’, which has expanded its reach into new forms of media. Despite being a pseudo-science, astrology has nevertheless proven its staying power, fluctuating between mainstream attention and rejection since its fall from scientific grace. By analyzing one of the most prolific socialized personal astrology apps on the market, The Pattern, and deconstructing its interoperable layers of meaning production this research examines how these layers converge to construct a hyper-personalized vision of the ‘self’ and the affective potency and ideological underpinnings of this construction. With the consideration of  Adorno’s notion of astrology as an ‘ideology of dependence’, this research examines how its combination with the imaginary media of mobile apps further extends its influence.

 INTRODUCTION

Astrology is a belief system which claims to derive knowledge about human affairs from the movements and relative positions of celestial objects, with the earliest evidence of gleaning ‘information from the sky’ found in cave markings of lunar cycles dating back 25,000 years (Zarka 2011;Campion 2008). Despite being considered a ‘scientific tradition’ for the majority of human history, the Enlightenment's paradigm-shifting mass adoption of the scientific method led to the discipline being expunged from academic discourse in the 19th century, with treaties such as Saunders’ Discourse on the Invalidity of Astrology demonstrating the hostile attitude of the time (Campion 2008; Gijswijt-Hofstra 1999). This excommunication has been referred to as a byproduct of the Enlightenment’s ‘de-souling project’ which leveraged the scientific method towards the “elimination of the soul or spirit as an aspect of the real” (Farman 2019). However, despite its severance from scientific disciplines such as astronomy, meteorology, and medicine, its loss of academic status, and a decline in common belief during this time, astrology remained popular in spheres such as literature, art, occultism, and alternative medicine (Campion 2008). 

 In the 1930’s, astrology was once again re-introduced into the mainstream when horoscopes began appearing in newspapers such as The Sunday London Express, garnering an overwhelmingly “enthusiastic public response” and propelling astro-journalists to celebrity status (Tandoc 2014). In turn, this mass media adoption of astrology as a cultural form prompted theoretical interest into its function from prominent 20th century intellectual figures (Oestmann et al 2005). Roland Barthes, in a short essay in Mythologies (1957), designated astrology as the “literature of the petit bourgeoisie world” (189), which in its adherence to “social status and the boss’s calendar” (187) provides a mirror to the social world - “the mere institution of reality” (187). Alternatively, Frankfurt school theorist, Theodore Adorno, in a thorough qualitative analysis of the LA Times astrology column, compared astrology to fascist regimes which, through ‘pseudo-rationality’, both “‘isolated’ and at the same time collectivized” (26) their followers in order to affirm the established order and institutionalize an ‘ideology of dependence’ (1974).

The popularity of astrology has been attributed to various cultural trends such as the expansion of ‘wellness’ industries in neo-liberal societies, the proliferation of mental health discourses, as well as notable ideological shifts such as postmodern irony and the post-truth climate (Dinan 2019; Buck 2018; Smallwood 2020). In the current techno-cultural climate, astrology finds itself at the intersection of pop culture, digital media, and 21st century spirituality. The ‘Astrological Renaissance’, which is a somewhat ironic term used to denote the rapid resurgence of astrology and astrology-adjacent products in the mainstream, is traced back to 2012, with American skepticism falling to a record low since 1983 (Robb 2020). The millennial generation is often credited for this comeback, with think-pieces often citing the generation’s socio-cultural maladjustment as the rationale for engaging in escapist fantasies. However, interest in astrology is only increasing in younger generations, who, in addition to adopting the belief system into their lexicon, have also revived a significant amount of neo-pagan traditions in digital spaces (Jones 2019). During this time, astrology has also taken on a quasi-political character (Schwartz 2020), with articles such as Why Straight Men Hate Astrology So Much (Ewens 2018), positioning the tradition as an antagonist to the patriarchal structure, with the view that ‘toxic masculinity’ prevents men from enjoying the benefits of its self-help potentialities, which are only accessible to those who are ‘emotionally intelligent’ enough to decipher its applicability (Ardere 2019; Rowan 2003). In this sense, astrology can be said to have a growing influence as an esoteric semantic system for the articulation of complex notions such as ‘personality’, ‘compatibility’, ‘destiny’, etc (Case 2004). 

  

ASTROLOGY APPS 

The emergence of personalized socially-networked astrology apps, with the two most prominent being Co-star and The Pattern, is exemplary of this shift in perspective (The Big Business of Astrology Apps 2019). Co-star, the first app of its kind, imagines astrology as a ‘language’, with the app’s founder, Banu Guler, stating that its aim resides in “merging  the resonance of the humanities with the precision of technology to produce new modes of rethinking ourselves and others” (costarastrology.com). The Pattern’s founder, Lisa Donovan, shared a similar sentiment, stating that her initial intent was to create a ‘Facebook for the soul’ (Regensdorf 2021). 

The majority of mainstream media coverage of the apps has been positive, glossing over the fact that astrology has no factual basis in favor of emphasizing their utility in promoting honest and vulnerable conversations about identity and personal struggles. Even academic analysis of their social affordances show remarkable signs of digital utopianism. In an anonymous article entitled Co-star: Personalized Astrology as a Form of Communication ,  the author argues that in this case the technology is a “productive force that makes users relate to self and others”, mediating friendship through ‘both human and non-human software actions’ which “produce meanings and meaningfulness”’(2020). This reconsideration of astrology’s socio-cultural value is indicative of the departure from the postmodern ambivalence which kept the tradition in a state of limbo, suggesting a trajectory towards a more sincere engagement with the discipline’s potentialities. 

However, astrology has always developed as a multiplicity and it’s recent ‘appliancization’ bears further witness to the semantic flexibility of the tradition (Zittrain 2008). The two apps are radically different in the ways in which they realize their visions. Co-star, an AI-powered app, presents its users with heavily stylized ‘pulp-type’ astrological content which attempts to “impress the readers both with "esoteric" knowledge and with "scientific" elaborateness” (Adorno 1974, 21), while The Pattern eliminates all astrological verbiage, presenting its users with insights in the form of passages, without any astrological data. 

What is particularly curious about The Pattern, however, is the seeming intensity of its emotional resonance with its users, with some even going so far as to label it an app for ‘masochistic astrology enthusiasts’ and as a vessel of “emotional terrorism” (Stef 2018). There are countless testimonials on Twitter and Instagram proclaiming the ways in which the app has ‘destroyed’ them or ‘read them for filth’ (Kacala 2019). While reactions on social media are often exaggerated for the purposes of the medium, Google’s related searches reveal an alarmingly earnest and perhaps more sinister picture (fig. 1)

The notion that an astrology app is ‘spying’ on its users, collecting bits of data and synthesizing them into long, personal passages concerning their psychological state and relationships with others, while being indicative of a larger concern surrounding big data, is also evidence of the app’s efficiency in convincing users of its legitimacy.  Far from Adorno’s description of LA Times readers ‘choosing’ to believe in astrology, The Pattern’s users seem compelled to think that the app has accessed personal information, whether that be through its interpretation of celestial objects or otherwise. I, myself, have watched friends and family, some of whom have never exhibited even a slight interest in astrology, spend countless hours transfixed by this application and, in many instances, the reactions which I witnessed could only be described as ‘cathartic’.

Until recently, the origins of The Pattern were shrouded in mystery (Smith and Worthington 2020). Marketed as a ‘personality’ tool without any overt reference to its astrological basis, the app gained widespread traction in 2019 after a bewildered Channing Tatum posted about it on his Instagram (Midkiff 2019). Despite its newfound notoriety and growing user base, the app was notably absent from social media platforms. The only mention of its creator, Lisa Donovan, was an off-hand mention in a New York Times article entitled Venture Capital is Putting Its Money into Astrology (Griffith 2019), which discussed the phenomenon of astrology apps as a general market trend. However, in anticipation of the app’s expansion into the dating services market (The Pattern Connect), Donovan has begun appearing in the press. Vanity Fair released a full profile, charting her career trajectory from Youtuber to Maker Studios co-founder to “the engine behind The Pattern” (Regensdorf 2021).  She appears as a striking image of what Adorno would refer to as a “homespun philosopher”(1974, 13): learning about astrology through “an apprenticeship via protracted phone calls'' as well as devoting three years to “writing the site’s introspective prose poems and largely self-funding its execution.” (Regensdorf 2021). Donovan stated that, over the course of the Covid-19 pandemic, the time spent on the app has doubled, and has recently crossed the threshold of 15 million generated profiles without any PR or marketing efforts (Regensdorf 2021). While all of the features were initially free, the app has recently limited access to information about compatibility bonds and introduced a Premium subscription service. 

This research considers the extent to which The Pattern constitutes an ‘ideology of dependence’, focusing on the ways in which it manages to make its users feel ‘seen’ and even, at times, ‘exposed’. By exploring the app’s layers of meaning production and its approach to personalization, sociality and temporality as well as drawing parallels between Adorno’s analysis, this research aims to examine digital astrology’s affective and ideological potency as well as its potentiality as a post-truth attention economy. In this context, the affective potency of a digital environment is conceptualized as affective flows which “construct atmospheres of emotional and cultural belonging by way of emotional resonance and alignment” (Doveling et al 2018,  2).

  

Methodology

In order to do justice to the complexity of the subject, the research uses a hybrid methodology combining Adorno’s qualitative content analysis with an infrastructural app studies approach, in order to ‘decode’ The Pattern’s appeal to its users. In these terms, there are two layers of ‘content’ which are considered: the ‘text’ itself, i.e the corpus of interpretative passages, and the ‘text’ of the software.

Apps themselves have been theorized as ‘imaginary media’ (Swiss 2015) which deal with the desires and anxieties of their users through prosthetic means, yet never fulfill these desires fully in order to retain their user base (Evans 2016).While the message of the text transmits the app’s ideological inscriptions, it is the app’s structure and interface affordances which re-assemble and contextualize this information in order to construct the personal ‘meaning’ of the text for each individual user.  Adorno’s critique of astrology is rooted in its psychology. Therefore, in order to analyze The Pattern’s ideology through Adorno’s conceptual framework, it is necessary to consider the  ‘psychology’ of the software by examining its assemblage of the ‘self’ through the  synthesis of its text, algorithm and affordances. In a way, Adorno’s prescience in predicting the astrological boom is quite extraordinary. In his reading of a column which he himself described as ‘moderate’ and to any modern reader would seem particularly drab and lacking flair, Adorno saw the desire for the appeal to an authority outside oneself, an ‘abstract authority’ beyond reproach (1974). In some ways, the ‘appliancization’ of astrology has given way to increased democratization, going beyond the simple affirmation of “business as usual” (Adorno 1974, 16) yet in others, the digital means through which this system functions serve to obfuscate the same ‘ideology of dependence’ which gave him pause. Adorno’s critique of astrology has remained influential, mostly due to his ability to bypass the question of scientific validity and instead focus on the formal aspects of astrology as a constructed ‘language’ within a particular medium. Through both quantitative and qualitative methods, this research aims to do the same within a digital context by expanding the notion of language to account for the technical and non-technical layers which determine the app’s user experience. 

Infrastructural app studies considers the app’s ‘situatedness’, i.e its relation to material and non-material objects and, due to the difficulty of studying apps, suggests researchers find experimental entry-points and/or disrupt its normal functioning (Dieter 2019; Gerlitz 2016). The app is conceptualized as technological ‘assemblage’, a “multilayered structure of software protocol stacks in which network technologies operate within a modular and interdependent order”, which customize and localize the experience of each individual user and can enter into relations with other things, practices, systems, and structures (Gerlitz et al 2019, 5;). This research attempts to gain insight into The Pattern through partial infrastructural inversion (Kaltenbrunner 2015), in order to examine its articulation of the ‘self’ and the institutionalization of a ‘social imaginary’ through its embeddedness in astrology software. Thus, the research aims to deconstruct the app’s system of interoperalisations to identify sites of notable departures from normative functions of the discipline’s digital form. The research focuses primarily on the ‘You’ section of The Pattern, particularly on the ‘Your Pattern’ screen which consists of personalized modules of information that first show the user a 1-2 paragraph summary of the text and offer the user the option to ‘Go Deeper’, which reveals a collection of slides expanding on this aspect of the user’s personality. 


Data Collection and Interpretation

The app’s latest updated form (3.3.41) was accessed through an IOS device.  The data points of 36 profiles were manually collected by changing the birth date to the 1st, 15th and 25th of each month in the year 2000. The time of birth was left at 00:00. Initially resulting in 321 data points, the duplicates were then discarded. This yielded a dataset of 160 passages ranging from 10 - 40 slides (each slide consisting of 1-2 sentences, 25 slides approx. 1000 words). Each passage was carefully read, noting the structure, style, word choice and general meaning of the text. The same profiles were then created in two ‘conventional’ astrology websites (cafeastrology.com and justastrologythings.com) which provide the user with a full chart and interpretation. Using the websites’ charts as a coding unit  (and Allen Edwall’s open source software as a ‘semantic guide’) as well as Donovan’s own admission of the correlation between certain placements such as Destiny/Ascendent sign as a starting point (Perez 2021), the data was triangulated, interpreted and tagged according to its natal chart correlations.  

The passages gathered were also interpreted and analyzed as a cohesive body of work, a corpus of prescriptive ‘prose poetry’(Regensdorf 2021). 


The Significance of Software

“We don’t use sun astrology, that was just invented to sell magazines. We use moon astrology.”

- Lisa Donovan, The Pattern founder  

Media change has a considerable impact on modes of prognostication (Green 2012). While pre-digital astrology relied on the knowledge of professional astrologers, meaning that a chart reading was often expensive and beyond the purview of the average person, astrology software, which was initially created in the 1970’s during the tradition’s New Age revival has radically modernized the discipline through its ‘democratization’ and ‘hyper-personalization’ of the personal horoscope (Breusman 2018). Even though astrology cannot be considered a science, the semantic systems which the discipline has cultivated can be considered, in the case of astrology apps, as elaborate ‘codes’ which have been algorithmically-interpreted, manipulated and re-synthesized for consumers (Beusman 2018). While it would be difficult, even for the most ‘prudent theologian’(Barthes 1957) to code the Bible, astrology’s basis on astronomical data and mathematics makes it particularly conducive to this type of endeavor.  

For 20th century theorists, the basis of the claims made in the astrology columns were arbitrary and irrelevant to the ideology which this ‘institutionalized superstition’ (Adorno 1974) inscribed. However, in the context of digital astrology apps, the astronomical data on which the text is based materializes through the software, constructing the notion of ‘personality’ and ‘self’ through the structure and affordances of each user’s profile, thereby institutionalizing the superstition on both a tangible and conceptual level (Trottier 2010).

  The absorption of horoscopes into the digital ‘meta-medium’ of software (Manovich 2013) has created a normative framework for the interpretation of an individual’s ‘chart’, substituting the ‘professional opinion’ of astrologers for the rapid calculation of placements and brief explanations of their meanings (Free Astrology Programs by Allen Edwall). For the most part, astrology apps, both social and non-social, have relied on this normative structure.  

The Pattern app, however, marks a significant divergence from the norm, re-imagining the astrology column through a communal digital medium. Therefore, through the inversion of The Pattern’s correlations, the aim is not to assess their ‘truth value’ but to comparatively examine the extent to which the app has appropriated the astrological matrix of meanings, i.e its symbolic and/or semantic system, and, through its unconventional approach towards its textual and technical synthesis, re-constructed the notion of ‘self’ in its own image. As Adorno notes: “the ready-made "alienated" character of astrology, however, should not lead us to the oversimplification that it is something entirely ego-alien.”(1974, 28)

  

THE TEXT AS CODE

In his analysis of the LA Times column, Adorno noted that the text functioned as a ‘sphere of innuendo’, hinting at the social structure of the external world. The Pattern also functions through a sphere of innuendo, however, in this case, the values are reversed, talking freely of the social world while only hinting at astrology itself. 

Since this research focuses on the normative semantic forms of astrology software, rather than their spiritual incarnations, it is not necessary to go too far into the tradition itself due to the fact that relevant symbolic meanings will be explained throughout. However, for the purposes of presenting my findings, it is necessary to clarify the terminology. An astrological chart is made up of three components: the 12 Signs, the Planets (and other celestial bodies), and the 12 Houses. At any given time, each Sign and Planet are always in a House, this is referred to as a ‘Placement’. Each of these elements have their own symbolic meaning, and acquire additional symbolic meaning when combined with each other.  Finally, the planets’ relations to each other are referred to as ‘Aspects’. There are five major types of aspects and each one carries its own symbolic meaning, some creating tension and others promoting well-being. The way in which astrology software produces natal charts is through calculating the positions of the planets at the time of birth and organizing them into the 12 sections of a chart according to the 12 houses. These placements are tagged with characteristics which, when the chart is calculated, assemble into interpretive texts. 

Through the employment of the methodology, which consisted of initially correlating the Destiny variables with the profile’s Ascendant signs and using those connections towards deciphering the other patterns and their variables before inductively applying the findings to the more dense patterns, all of the patterns were successfully matched to an astrological source (fig. 2). Furthermore, out of the 160 data points, each one was successfully correlated to either a sign or a ruling planet, and 147 were further categorized into pure, aspect or complex placements, which will be explained further on. 13 variables remain uncategorized because they could not be correlated directly to a single point on the chart.

While The Pattern does not incorporate the user’s entire natal chart into the profile, it does encode the text with signifiers which reference established horoscopic interpretations. At the most basic level, while the app does not employ astrological symbols explicitly, the text does condense each sign to its archetypal essence and consistently encodes its characteristics through 3-5 adjectives and/or concepts (fig. 3). Some of these archetypal forms can be grouped together based on shared elements of their temperament. Gemini and Sagittarius, for example, are both described as independent and free-spirited while Capricorn 

and Aries are both oriented towards positions of authority. Yet, each sign retains its own

specific and unmistakable character throughout, coming into contact with various internal and external forces. Through the extraction of the core semantic essence, the passages code astrological data into the language itself and unlike the signs, which are positioned as external icons exerting influence on the individual, these textual forms are easily internalized as the individual’s own predispositions (fig. 4).

Furthermore, the six major components or ‘patterns’ through which the user comes into ‘being’, the elements through which the app conceptualizes the structure of the personality - Instincts, Growth, Relationship Experiences, Ideal Partner Traits, Destiny and At Work & In The World - all relate to certain aspects on a conventional astrological chart (fig. 5). The category of Instincts correspond with the user’s moon sign and its aspects.

	Figure 5. The correlation between Modules and Placements

  

In horoscopic astrology, the moon sign is usually described as an individual’s ‘emotional core’. However, while emotions are subject to change, The Pattern’s emphasis on the centrality of this aspect, in an almost visceral, animalistic way, inscribes it as the individual’s guiding quality, the impetus behind everything they do. 

Growth is the component with the most variables and while it mostly correlates to the individual’s Venus sign and its aspects, it can also house the Sun’s ‘hard’ aspects when they occur, if they are particularly strong. Venus has been mostly codified as the planet which accounts for the individual’s romantic and aesthetic sensibilities, as well as leisure time and material possessions.  The Pattern departs from this, conceptualizing the placement as a part, or side, of the individual which they need to develop, essentially re-imagining romantic attraction as a general life trajectory for which the individual needs to develop and ‘embrace’ certain qualities. 

The structure of these two types of passages is very similar, with both establishing a core desire or trait, revealing its strengths and weaknesses, telling the individual the ways in which this quality is prone to being misunderstood by the outside world and offering some advice. The text’s framing presents the information as a ‘spiritual etiquette’ of sorts, a pragmatic approach to ethereal matters. As in Adorno’s analysis, the view of ‘rationality’ is inscribed as acceptance: “"To be rational" means not questioning irrational conditions, but to make the best of them from the viewpoint of one's private interests” (1974, 21). While the text always urges the individual not to conform or buckle to the pressure of their surroundings, there are only three concrete levels of advice: ‘embrace this quality’ , ‘accept this quality’, or ‘explore other qualities’ in yourself. Even through this subtle turn of phrase, it is established whether the Moon/Venus placement is in a fortuitous place on the chart. 

The next two components in a user’s Pattern are Relationship Expectations and Ideal Partner Traits, based on the individual’s Mars and 7th House placements respectively. Mars, the planet of sex and aggression, in this context denotes that which the individual wants but does not need. The passages in this pattern tell the individual that while the attraction is understandable, it is also harmful, suggesting that they develop these qualities within themselves rather than living vicariously through their partner and remaining spiritually unsatisfied. The Ideal Partner Traits, on the other hand, correlating to the individual’s sign in the house which represents Partnership, describe the qualities which are ‘vital’ for a long-term relationship. This, however, has the capacity to be problematic since an individual may have the same sign in both of these placements.

The last two components of the profile, Destiny and At Work & In The World, are also similar in their form. While Destiny is based on the individual’s Ascendent sign placement, which denotes their ‘social personality’ or the ‘mask they wear’, At Work & In The World is based on the Midheaven, astrology’s designated ‘professional’ placement. Both of these passages are relatively short, ranging about 10-15 slides, and speak very matter-of-factly and authoritatively about the individual’s intended path. In a way, the similarity of these two components cheapens the grand notion of ‘destiny’ but they both fulfill the function of turning the individual outward, towards the external world. There are also two minor components: Communication which houses Mercury aspects and Home & Roots which relates to Midheaven hard aspects yet they only account for 5 variables across the entire data set.

The passages can further be divided into three corollary categories: Pure sign texts, Aspect texts and Complex texts.  Pure sign texts are texts which correlate to any given sign without taking the aspects into account. Modules with fewer variables, such as Ideal Partner Traits and Destiny, almost exclusively consist of these texts, making them more straightforward and focused while more dense modules, such as Growth, employ stylistic signatures to set them apart. In Instincts, for example, each pure sign text begins with “You came into this world as a…”  (The Pattern 2021) followed by a trait or quality of the individual. This emphasis on the moment of birth underscores the sign’s all-encompassing totality, rather than being a byproduct of particular planetary influence. Aspect texts, which denote the relation between a sign and a planet, are written in a similar manner but they refer to a ‘side’ or ‘part’ of the individual rather than their inherent nature. Finally, Complex texts or hard aspects are texts which denote particularly unfavorable aspects, labelled in the app as ‘Fears & Frustrations’, ‘Communication Blocks’, ‘Security Angst’. These texts are not bound to specific signs or modules and can appear throughout, given that there is a hard aspect present. They refer to the particular struggles which the individual is ‘destined’ to face but do not make any claims about the personality as such. Aspect and Complex texts take precedence in the Instincts and Growth patterns of the app, meaning that the user will not receive a pure sign text if there is a strong aspect in their Moon or Venus. They can, however, receive more than one text per module if their chart shows 2 or more strong aspects/complexes relating to that pattern. For the other four patterns, users receive the Pure sign text regardless, with the Aspect or Complex texts, if applicable, shown above.   

Finally, the aspect and complex texts were matched to specific aspect types. While aspect texts were the hardest to correlate accurately due to the fact that The Pattern reuses the same passages for different types of aspects, the complex placements were fairly straightforward. The methodology found no correlations with the Trine aspect, 1 correlation with a Sextile, 16 Conjunctions, 20 Oppositions and 24 Squares (fig. 6)

The Trine and Sextile are the most auspicious aspects in astrology, with Conjunctions being positive or negative depending on their positions and Oppositions and Squares denoting hardship or struggle (Free Astrology Programs by Allen Edwall). This is perhaps the most illuminating finding, showing that the app is heavily biased towards ‘negative’ aspects of an individual’s natal chart, with the only notable exceptions being prominent Jupiter conjunctions which show up in the text as the ‘Ability to Manifest’. This means that the app purposefully tries to present the users with the most ‘challenging’ aspects of their charts while almost wholly disregarding the more ‘uplifting’ and flattering placement (Ahmad 2011). This can be interpreted as a way to make the user ‘confront’ their darker side in the interest of ‘self-improvement’ or as a way to make the app seem more ‘real’ to users through the production of negative affect, which is associated with the more ‘confessional’ and ‘intimate aspects of digital behaviour (Berryman and Kavka 2018). The planets, which are most often found in the variables’ aspects are Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, all have their own shorthands within the app’s semantic structure: prominent Saturn aspects are signalled through the use of the words such as ‘responsibility’ or ‘discipline’, Uranus through ‘original’ or ‘unique’, Neptune as ‘idealistic’ and Pluto as ‘depth’ or ‘fear’. 

The findings in this section show a strong correlation between an individual’s pattern profile and their chart. However, the re-formulation of their personality through the variation in the order of the modules as well as the particular focus on the user’s struggles suggest a construction of identity based largely on its internal conflicts and problems. 

  

THE TEXT AS MESSAGE

“You came into this life with an incredibly layered and complex soul.”

( The Pattern 2021)

  
While the previous section considered the text of the passages as astrological codes, this section engages with the text as prescriptive ‘prose poetry’, a designation which Donovan bestowed upon her own work (Regensdorf 2021), comparing it with Adorno’s analysis, in order to discuss the app’s prognostational ‘style’ as a factor in its affect production and astrology’s shifting ideological content. Prose poetry, in both its French Symbolist and Postmodernist forms, has always been a genre of subversion (Murphy 1992). By integrating algorithmically produced characteristics into structured vessels of prose, Donovan subverts conventional causality and instead uses the cultural attachment to ‘personality’ as an entry point for the delivery of ‘universal’ messages. As shown in the previous section, the specific characteristics, i.e the personal qualities foregrounded in the texts, are determined by the 12 zodiac signs. Therefore, in order to gain understanding of the texts’ larger implications it is necessary to look at the repeating notions and  cultural forms which appear intertextually, considering the overall tone and style of the corpus. 

When reading the contents of a single profile, the passages initially seem to be personalized towards the needs of the individual reading, acknowledging their struggles on a deep level and encouraging them to overcome them with concluding slides such as: “Ideally, you’re open to evolving and accepting all parts of yourself, no matter how different they seem” (The Pattern 2021). 

However, when considering the corpus of texts from a larger scope and reading the passage texts through a critical lens, it quickly becomes apparent that the app’s ‘interpretive depth’ and ‘eloquence’ is largely an illusion manufactured through the presentation and structuring of the information, rather than its content. While it’s not readily apparent, The Pattern’s prognostational prose style vacillates somewhere between radical self-acceptance, nonchalance and a sense of profound existential angst. The texts themselves are extremely recursive and for the most part, aimless, often going in circles without the semblance of any meaningful resolution, relying solely on the constant bi-phasic juxtaposition between positive and negative statements. Adorno described the ‘bi-phasic approach’ in depth in his analysis, stating that it permeates the entire column as a way to “dispense with contradictory requirements of life by the simple device of distributing these requirements” (1974, 43). Thus, every good quality, trait or desire which the text attributes to the individual is quickly problematized, leading to every positive trait inevitably becoming the direct source of the individual’s alienation and suffering. The ‘environment’ in which the individual has grown up in is always framed as repressive, with parents either being domineering or overly concerned, and the dichotomy of repression/expression as well as inhibition/exhibition, in terms of the individual’s reaction to their environment, as a staple addition to every possible quality which they may have. Fundamentally, the text posits a state of continuous imbalance. 

Adorno notes something similar in his analysis: “They are incessantly beset by irreconcilable and contradictory requirements or their own psychological economy as well as of social reality: the column constructs its addressee as being "frustrated."” (42)

The rapid turnaround between the exaltation of the individual as unique, charismatic, seductive, etc. followed by the way in which these qualities agitate their friends, family and partners mirrors a kind of god/inferiority complex cycle which is quite affectively striking when represented in a covert horoscopic astrology context. Once again, this is representative of this bi-phasic approach. The form of the texts can thus be described as a constantly swinging pendulum, the most basic of patterns - a constant cycling between rebellion and repression, which the individual is eventually advised to escape in order to step into their power: 

 “Immerse yourself in all things that support your life intent. You’ll feel a deep sense of satisfaction and relief when you’ve found your way - it’s an inner knowledge that your direction has aligned with what’s intended” (The Pattern 2021)

Due to the personalized and intimate nature of the app’s digital environment, the text can function on two levels at the same time: as the ‘objective’ arbiter of the personality as well as the meta-commentator which speaks to the individual directly, telling them that even if they don’t think that this is true, it definitely is. As Adorno notes: “People are allowed to enjoy communion with absolute strength in as much as it is considered no longer human”(1974, 21).  While algorithmically determined statements concerning the individual’s personality are presented bluntly and unabashedly, the text constantly hedges its bets through the use of words such as ‘likely’ , ‘might’, and ‘could’, as well as constantly presenting ‘either/or’ scenarios and alternatives such as the inhibition/exhibition dichotomy mentioned previously. Once again, this follows a similar pattern to the one found in the LA Times column: “What he says must sound as though he had concrete knowledge of what problems beset each of his prospective followers born under some sign at a specific time. Yet he must always remain non-committal enough so that he cannot be easily discredited” (Adorno 1974, 28). This, however, is only in reference to the way in which the individual has dealt with being ‘this way’, a totality which, by virtue of its own acknowledgement, can never be undermined. The individual, as constructed in the text, doesn’t even know themselves enough to have a say in whether these claims apply to them. 

While astrology prognostications have a reputation for being too vague, the condensation of the zodiac signs into core elements of personality, as discussed in the previous section, precludes the text from ceding any ground. In regards to emotions, for example, there are clear delineations between individuals who are overly analytical and detached, the ones who are too sensitive or intense, the ones who are stubborn or too scared of vulnerability and the ones who are too needy or codependent. In light of this, it becomes unclear whether it is astrology that is false or the very notion of a singular, unified personality which could ever act as a site of verification for such a claim (Case 2004).   

One of the most prominent themes throughout is the emphasis on the suffering caused by the individual’s discordance with society, espousing hyper-individualistic values to an extent that’s almost misanthropic. While, at times, the individual self-sabotages themselves and, at others, they are ‘destined’ to deal with the irrational forces and circumstances which the universe bestows on them, it is always the ‘friends, family and culture’ which emerge as the greatest barrier to their happiness. Throughout the entire corpus, friends, family and ‘culture’ are framed as antagonistic and suppressive forces which constantly exert pressure upon the individual and lead them astray from their ‘intended path’. The user is, therefore, always presumed to be misunderstood, alienated, and miserable and it is constantly re-affirmed that everybody around wants them to change, “the antagonism between the individual and the universal cannot be altogether reduced to instinctual dynamics but pertains also to the objective sociological dimension” (Adorno 1974, 52).

The text, however, is quick to remind them that it’s ‘okay to be different’:

 “For you to feel truly authentic, aligned and content with yourself, it’s imperative to embody your independent, unusual nature. Embrace the side of you that feels free enough to be yourself despite the influence of your friends, family or culture.” ( The Pattern 2021)


Adorno noted that the column altered between encouraging individuality and adjustment. In this respect, The Pattern takes a more singular approach. The central call to action, or rather inaction, is to never settle or ‘conform’. Conformity, according to the text, inevitably leads to anxiety and depression. Independence is celebrated while romance is de-emphasized. Even the two passages concerning relationships re-iterate that “no single person could ever satisfy your needs fully”, with the constant reminder that one needs to learn to be their own partner first. Beyond that, the individual is also encouraged to embrace complexity, stop victimizing themselves and accept that people are ‘multi-dimensional’. However, this is not as direct as it might seem. In Adorno’s words: “The adage "be yourself'' assumes an ironical meaning. The socially manipulated stimuli constantly aim at reproducing that frame of mind which is spontaneously engendered by the status quo itself.” (1974, 42)

Considering the mainstream media’s coverage of the app’s utility as a self-help tool, one might think that it’s tone would be more based on ‘reality’. However, while the text certainly employs psychological concepts such as ‘repression’ and discusses childhood experiences and interpersonal dynamics, the language is by no means 'over realistic’. On the contrary, while the app limits astrological verbiage to a minimum, the justifications for its claims are presented as explicitly supranatural, with words and phrases such as ‘initiation’, ‘sacred calling’, ‘energy field’, ‘irrational forces and circumstances’, ‘destiny’ and ‘intention’ (attributed to a spiritual realm) are scattered generously throughout the passages with the extent to which they are applied either figuratively or literally completely obscure. However, this is more related to the general linguistic shift in ‘post-secular modernities’ which have adopted more spiritual language to describe both internal and external events (Possamai 2017). 

Every once in a while, the text turns its lens on the individual,  once again confirming that “it is practically directed towards action in spite of all the lofty talk about cosmic secrets and profound meditation” (Adorno 1974, 22), with slides such as: 

“Ultimately all these choices are yours to make and these instructions are merely clues. It’s not necessarily the path of least resistance, but it’s a possibility for what could be, and for how you might feel most fulfilled” (The Pattern 2021)

One of the most effective elements of the app’s design is the way in which the texts become progressively shorter and more authoritative as the user moves through their profile. While the passages on Instincts and Growth wax and wane, allowing for a wide spectrum of personal interpretation, the subsequent passages present their insights far more bluntly and uncompromisingly, backing the reader into a corner by leveraging all acquired influence towards far more pointed and concrete determinations. In these texts, the authority takes on an almost threatening tone, telling the individual that bad things might happen to them if they don’t adhere to their destiny. Once again this is mirrored in Adorno’s analysis: “the heavy employment of the "impending doom" device is hardly accidental. It encourages the addressee's destructive urges and feeds on their discomfort in civilization, while at the same time stirring up a bellicose mood” (1974, 24). 

The text, however, remains relatively ambivalent towards the late capitalist establishment. The passages in the Destiny and At Work & In The World patterns, which are the most concrete and externally oriented texts, base their advice solely on the individual’s placements with Capricorn risings encouraged to follow their ambitions and Pisces risings told to find their calling and ‘be of service’. Materialism and ‘selling out’ are mostly discouraged, with the individual mostly being encouraged to follow their own unique path. Yet there is somewhat of a hedonistic streak. Individuals are told not to allow themselves to be shamed for being ‘selfish’ and wanting to live a ‘provocative’ and exciting life. In the passage related to Taurus risings, whose destiny is to ‘enjoy and savor their life’, the text states that these individuals should spend at least half of the day enjoying themselves, before noting that “it may be difficult to find a career which allows for that” (The Pattern 2021). However, there is a sense that these positions are too out of touch with material conditions to engage with them at all, whether it be to re-inscribe or critique them. Far from Barthes ‘literature of the petit bourgeoisie’ which was at the very least aware of the reality which it was mirroring, The Pattern’s insights seem to be particularly impotent in this respect.  

The Pattern’s text is simultaneously meticulous in its structure yet incredibly chaotic in its messaging. However, as an ‘ideology of dependence’ it employs many of the same stylistic forms which were described in Adorno’s analysis: the dichotomies of threat/help as well as narcissism/anxiety are heavily relied upon to make the individual ‘see’ themselves in the text and rely on it to guide them. Beyond an overarching propulsion towards hyper-individualism, the text barely ‘says’ anything at all, but sometimes it manages to be comforting.The text’s most uplifting parts are simultaneously the most depressing. Its relentless emphasis on internal struggle and pain as an inherently positive experience because of the way in which it imbues the individual with a depth of character is an insight which, although problematic and cliche, somehow captures a certain lightness of spirit in the face of melancholy, rage and paranoia - “an attempt is being made to cater to various layers of demands in the readers, to those more deep-lying ones where the spectacle of the twilight of the gods is hoped for as well as to the level where one wants to be reassured” (Adorno 1974, 23). 

INTERFACE

This section focuses on interface and its construction of an ‘ideal user’ in order to examine the last frontier of the app’ affective power. The interface of the app is the last layer of meaning which is applied before the user engages with it.  From its soft - launch in 2017, The Pattern has consistently updated its interface with an ever-increasing amount of features and affordances, ‘furnishing’ the app for its users (Schepen 2019). Some of the most recent additions include posting on the ‘Daily’ feed, direct messaging, and the addition of the journal feature in which the user can note their thoughts and feelings. In this oversaturated digital climate, the app’s singular identity is becoming increasingly confused and confusing. By attempting to combine the intimacy of the notes app with the sociability of the public feed, it seems as though the developers are desperately trying to make the app a more inviting environment for its users. However, this over-enthusiasm hampers the app’s overall character and conceals the truly visionary features which made it such an enigma in the first place. In light of this, this section examines the cognitive, social and temporal affordances which made The Pattern notorious among the astrological community and accounted for the app’s initial radical entry into the digital astrology ecosystem. 

  

Cognitive Affordances 

Considering apps as an imaginary media (Swiss 2015) which has been hailed for its potential for non-fiction writing (Allen 2015), cognitive affordances are considered as what the app allows and encourages the user to think, and feel, during their interaction (Jensen and Pedersen 2016; Molnillo et al 2020). The Pattern’s interface, in comparison to Co-star’s sleek design, for example, has always been rather humble, remaining consistently focused on centering the user. The app’s architecture of personality, found on the ‘Your Pattern’ screen of the app, is structured according to a generative logic of traits, beginning from the smallest unit and gradually expanding throughout.  However, The Pattern conceptualizes the most essential core of the personality as something prelingual - the profile picture. This element of the interface, which is scaled to roughly half of the screen, is an algorithmically generated image which, although placed behind the other components, nevertheless dominates the visual hierarchy of the user profile. This serves to establish the user’s ‘individuality’, giving them a non-verbal, symbolic representation through which they can conceptualize their overall ‘personality’ (Fig. 7). There are 13 image options in total and while the images can theoretically be considered as corresponding to the four elements, their exact correlations remain unclear.

The use of landscapes and natural imagery, akin to a default desktop background, primes the user for the app’s further claims regarding their personal ’nature’. They manage to simultaneously evoke the implied grandeur of natural forces and the human spirit as well as a kind of parody regarding the familiarity of wild, remote locations contained within a screen. While the app allows users to change their profile picture, the picture which the user was ‘dealt’ after their registration acts as a symbol of initiation, like the sorting hat, which determined their energy intuitively and welcomed them into their ranks.

As the user moves towards the first text component and reaches the summary page, the conceptual affordance of the ‘Go Deeper’ button as well as the use of slides instead of block text, activate the user’s imagination and create a liminal space beyond the screen through which the user moves as they read through their patterns. This narrative ‘journey’ through the passages, which is metaphorically, through the app’s language, tied to their internal world ‘feels’ like a revelation because it is designed as one. The Pattern interface becomes an oracle which is happy to  divulge its insights, but sparingly. 

The use of slides is also an essential feature for retaining the user’s attention (Ksinan 2021). The act of swiping allows the user to feel like they are participating on the interface level, constructing a ‘consensual’ system of information consumption and activating the user as an agent in their own Instincts, Destiny, etc. In this case, affective power is restored through the notion of a “relational concept of agency and becoming; neither property of humans, nor of technics, but emergent from their enactive combination.”(Poulsgaard 2019) Even when the information, although benign, becomes unpleasant. The interface’s design makes the accumulation of this information akin to the hero’s journey, equally a matter of bravery and perseverance. If the app gets the user with the first pattern, it’s got them for good: the amount of text which a user reads, provided they go through their entire profile and then, as many do, move onto the ‘Timings’, is quite astonishing, and what is perhaps even more astonishing, is if one considers the fact that around half of that text is purely a rephrasing of itself. This affordance re-invigorates the text and makes the user a hostage of their own curiosity. By gamifying introspection, the app makes each statement fertile ground for self-discovery as well as creating a rhythm of information flow in which the user and the app ‘converse’. The text remains revelatory and fresh by becoming impossible to grasp in its entirety. It is in the ‘experience’ of information, rather than in the information itself, that the user feels they have discovered themselves anew (Safta 2018).   

In this sense, the app creates a framework of perception specifically designed for compulsive consumption of confession as commodity. However, the relationship is distorted, with the user effectively reading their own confessions back to themselves and integrating them into their world view. As the pharmakon, both malaise and cure, The Pattern engages the users in a recurring and superficial emotional sadomasochism, in which the production of negative affect always serves to emphasize its value as a tool. The truth, according to this justification, is supposed to hurt. Ideologically the pain is part of the praxis of self discovery, a productive aspect of the app which makes users ‘confront’ themselves. The Pattern itself seems to be aware of this dynamic, embedding it into its ethos. As the ‘About Us’ screen states: “ideally, what you discover about yourself will reflect back things you already know - but may not always trust or accept” (The Pattern 2021). 

  

Social Affordances

Unlike Co-star, in which the astrological data acts as the sole communicational agent, without any messaging or commenting affordances in place, The Pattern’s interface allows users to interact by participating in the ‘Shared Experiences’ space, accessed through shared patterns. This affordance functions as any other comment section in which users are able to like and reply to each other except that the replies are sectioned off to a separate screen, creating smaller hubs of conversations within its bounds. The term ‘shared experiences’ implies an established familiarity which is assumed by virtue of the shared pattern  and when the user finds their way there for the first time they are greeted with a pop-up which reads “shared experiences remind us that we’re all connected” (The Pattern 2021) and stating that this is intended as a safe space to “share personal stories about how certain traits and cycles impact each of us” (The Pattern 2021) and asking the user to treat everyone with “respect, honesty, and kindness” (The Pattern 2021). This sectioning off of users into discrete conversational chambers within the app’s larger architecture does create a sense of safety and intimacy while also imbuing each of the spaces with a certain associative sensibility based on the pattern from which it stems. This space, which encourages its users to ‘share their experience’ functions as a support group in which many users share sensitive and personal information about themselves, often divulged by users in whole blocks of text and stating that they don’t want to burden their loved ones with their feelings but have the need to express themselves somewhere. Each user adapts the pattern to their own experience, making the entire ‘conversation’ a feedback loop for the confirmation of the app’s prescience. In his analysis of astrology as a mythology, Barthes noted that the individual seems to exist in ‘discrete’ realms: “between these “realms”, no communication: nothing which, from one agenda to another, might suggest the notion of a total alienation; the prisons are contiguous, they adjoin but don’t contaminate one another” (1957 187). The social architecture of the app gives this observation a fully-realized digitally-materialized counterpart, funnelling users into endless ‘chatrooms’ where they are encouraged to ‘share their experience’ in a modular fashion. Users therefore separate themselves according to the app’s separation of them. 

  

Temporal Affordances

Beyond The Pattern’s personalized profiles the app also provides users with their Timings  which show them the ‘cycles’ which they are currently going through. A user’s cycles are based on their specific chart’s correlation to celestial bodies, with The Pattern, in this case employing quite conventional forms of classification such as ‘Expansion of Potential’ or ‘Connections of Destiny’. The passages for these cycles are written in a similar manner to the patterns except with a more instructive tone, telling individuals to ‘stay open to new experiences’ or ‘focus on their goals’, etc.  A user will often have several ongoing cycles, with a couple of upcoming cycles which are waiting to start. This in itself is rather banal. 

However, while most accessible astrological prognoses are limited to a certain time-frame, The Pattern takes a radically different approach. In an audacious display of technology’s temporal ambivalence, The Pattern encourages its users to ‘Time Travel’ in order to, in Donovan’s words, “gain perspective on their past”(Regensdorf 2021). Due to the accessibility of astrological data, the scope of this affordance is almost impossibly broad, with the earliest year available being 1210 and the latest being 2380, meaning that a user can return back to their childhood or access a date in the future far beyond their lifespan. While ‘time collapse’ is customary in digital environments (Lohmeier 2020), this particular employment imbues the app with an almost ‘religious’ quality designed to evoke notions of transcendence in the user (Campbell et al. 2014). The app’s environment of expected use makes it so that the user goes to their Timings right after they have just read their Pattern, making their first confrontation with the entire scale of time a particularly existentially poignant moment, as they are quite immersed in the app’s internal logic of meaning. This technical ‘prosthesis’ not only foregrounds the ‘existential entanglement’ of humans and the technics which they use to measure time (Poulsgaard 2019), it also compounds the affective potency of the user’s introspective current state with the affective states from the past and possible states in the future. Just as the user finishes reading 5,000 - 7,000 words about themselves they are confronted with the ability to read about the emotional states and life cycles of all of their past and future selves. This particular context of time collapse is dangerous, activating both obsessive and paranoid dispositions into an endless loop of affective information which means nothing outside of the semantic architecture of the app (Ohman 2020). While users can check their pasts and find new ways in which to conceptualize their lived experiences which, although still confined to the app’s feedback loop, is fairly harmless and possibly even constructive, they can also look into their future. Seeing upcoming cycles such as ‘Major Life Changes’ or ‘Reality Check’ can throw unstable users into a tailspin. As Adorno notes: “interest in astrology, like a phobic symptom, may well absorb all other anxiety objects and may ultimately become an obsessive interest of the afflicted individual or group.”(1974, 28)

The Pattern’s radicalized temporal flexibility engages the user’s “ ability to anticipate (design) and implement (fabricate) different futures” (Poulsgaard 2019, 285) all within their own minds, living through experiences which have not happened yet, based on projections of their own fears and desires. As noted in the textual analysis, The Pattern’s texts are recursive and hollow, only capable of leading the individual back to themselves.This nearly infinite repository of condensed human experiences combined with the app’s hyper-personalized structure creates an associative matrix which only leads back to itself, yet has the capacity to impact the emotional states of its users in a profound and menacing way. The Pattern’s vision of time, which could almost be described as an example of the ‘digital sublime’ (Bennett 2020; Mosco 2005), while having the potential to provoke its users to transcend time altogether, is far more likely to have a negative effect, both on their self-image and mental state, and further their dependence on the app as an arbiter of their lived experience. 

  

DISCUSSION

The mass adoption of social media technologies into every aspect of life has simultaneously strengthened and posed a grave challenge to the liberal ideal of the ‘individual’. While the prosthetic expansion of the self into the virtual world though imaginary media has created new forms of self expression and embodiment, it has also led to the devastating recognition of one’s own inadequacy in comparison to their image, a phenomenon which Daniel R Smith has termed the ‘tragedy of the self’ (2017). Cognitive capitalism in the digital sphere which has established the ‘confession’ as a form of affective currency (Berryman and Kavka 2018), is only one example of the ways in which individuals are attempting to fulfill the impossible desire of self-remediation. Self-disclosure, in this sense, becomes a prerequisite of existence.   

Therefore,  it stands to reason that an ever-fragmenting modern world would require digital imaginaries of ‘institutionalized superstition’ (Adorno 1974) in order to reconstitute the individual as wholes, or at least, as in the case of The Pattern, as assemblages of conflicted thoughts and feelings. Notions such as ‘authenticity,’  and ‘uniqueness’ become stand-ins for the concept of a soul (Bauwens 1996; Schussler 2019). Thus, The Pattern’s operationalization of astrological aspects in order to emphasize internal struggles, fears and frustrations comes as no surprise. By foregrounding the ‘emotional core’ as opposed to the ‘ego’, and materializing the recursivity of emotional states through software,  The Pattern creates an architecture which appeals to the lowest common denominator, confining the user in a digital environment articulated entirely through a singular ‘voice’ which is at the same time hyper-personalized, providing the modern individual with the illusion of an absolute truth of their ‘personality’(Rudhyar 1936). The affective appeal of the app is therefore not to get in touch with anything resembling the divine, but to be realized and articulated through the eyes of ‘the Other’ as if it were yourself. 

In the article Astrology Year Zero, Lauren Oyler writes , “Astrology is like social media or Donald Trump or autofiction or reality TV: a destabilized cultural force, promoted by an elite media class that purports to get it, driven by fluctuating levels of seriousness and literality, something that stalls the development of a shared reality by being confusingly tautologically only what it is.”(2020)

The Pattern, in this context, is an entire digital ecosystem of non-meaning based entirely on this ‘confusing tautology’: it is post-truth by design, not necessarily by function. 

In a postmodern, late-capitalist society the question of astrology’s validity or invalidity in relation to technologies such as The Pattern is highly irrelevant (Brosio 1994; Pruzhinin 1995). It is simply an algorithm, a content delivery system. Adorno was prescient in recognizing astrology’s central appeal; the ability to authoritatively designate those who need it with a sense of ‘self’. In this sense, its affective potency would work just as well if the entire system was randomized, without the user having to put in any personal data. In the age of cognitive capitalism and the emergent ‘attention economy’, the amount of time which users spend on the app is the only measure of its ‘legitimacy’  (Bueno 2016). In this sense, the app’s design is structured to enable just that: appealing to its users narcissism and anxiety, separating information into small bite-size chunks, and allowing them to access the entirety of the past and present in order to obsessively consume their lives. 

In Chapter Four of The App Generation, Gardner and Davis discuss how the proliferation of apps lead individuals towards a ‘packaged sense of self’, noting that “this packaging has the consequence of minimizing a focus on an inner life, on personal conflicts and struggles, on quiet reflection and personal planning” (Gardner 2013, 61). By providing its users with a pre-packaged and static sense of self, with the explicit purpose of orienting them towards their inner life, The Pattern takes on the role of a spiritual guide by presenting common cliches through a crudely encoded veneer of personalized content. In this sense, The Pattern does not institutionalize superstition, it only uses it as an infrastructure upon which to build a culture-specific community of affective practice (Doveling et al 2018, 2) which in this case purports a quasi-realized take on the Californian ideology which Barbrook and Cameron describe as “self-fulfillment through therapy, spiritualism, exercise or other narcissistic pursuits.”  (Barbrook and Cameron 1996, 14). 

The Pattern synthesizes the same forces of narcissism and anxiety which were underscored in Adorno’s analysis, and employs the same threat - help approach which he described in order to create a post-truth attention economy of the self. As Gardner notes “in the psychoanalytic tradition, one speaks about narcissism not to indicate people who love themselves, but a personality so fragile that it needs constant support,  instead of self-assuredness, narcissists tend more toward a fragile self that needs propping up by external reassurances.”  (Gardner 2013 77)  The Pattern’s user base is dependent on the app for structure and spiritual guidance as well as ‘self-verification’, a strategy for coping with the difficult parts of life  (Cline 2016; Lilqvist 1998).  In this sense, The Pattern app is perfectly suited towards the consumers of its market, making the app one of the finest examples of  digital spiritual entrepreneurship on such a mass scale (Gregory 2013; Kieffer 2020). 

The amalgamation of astrology and apps’ seems almost predestined in itself, with apps constituting the same exact ‘ideology of dependence’ as astrology through their “delivery of partial solutions” that ensures users’ continued reliance on them, thereby perpetuating the app economy. (Evans 2016, 143) Astrology’s convergence with the app economy, the joining of these two forces, exponentially raises the stakes and experientially transforms both the tradition and its digital inscription into an ‘ideology of obsession’, making it far more profitable than its pre-digital counterpart. The sheer capacity of non-information overwhelms but, of course, never fully satisfies completely. It is not only the anxiety and narcissism which power The Pattern’s post-truth attention economy but also the impetus towards continuous consumption, the desire to binge on affective dispositions and prosthetic emotional states. 

CONCLUSION

The Pattern is an imaginary medium (Kantor 2015) which claims to mediate the impossible desire of being returned to a holistic state of selfhood (Guo 2015; Howes 2012). Through its selective use of the astrological framework and its formulaic yet exhaustive re-interpretation through text, The Pattern not only encourages an ‘ideology of dependence’ but actively uses it as a design principle, assembling empty signifiers into a digitally-mediated post-truth  attention economy. By alienating and analyzing separate layers of The Pattern’s ‘meaning’ construction, in which meaning and affect are one and the same, this research has found that the app employs both technical and non-technical means in order to produce a hyper-personalized and networked system of affect production, powered by the narcissistic vulnerabilities of its users (Arroyo 2012). The identification with the profile is largely based on the production of negative affect and the interpersonal exchange of confessional and attention currency. The Pattern’s ‘Image of the Addressee’ (Adorno 1974), its  ‘ideal user’, in this sense, is a person who views their ‘struggles’ as the purest representation of their identity and although they may think they want to break out of this cycle, they are hopelessly and compulsively bound to it. The app, just like the column, “attempts to satisfy the longings of people who are thoroughly convinced that others (or some unknown agency) ought to know more about themselves and what they should do than they can decide for themselves” (Adorno 1974, 17). Thus, it functions by claiming to bring users closer to themselves while, effectively, only alienating them further.   

Furthermore, the textual analysis showed the prevalence of hyper-individualistic values and a reliance on the bi-phasic approach to superstitious prognostication, thoroughly described by Adorno in his content analysis. Based on the logic of hyper-personalization, The Pattern’s interface affordances and features, which establish a personal relationship with the user, and create an experience of information which prosthetically mimics self-revelation and intimacy. The app also constructs an architecture of social spaces, centred around modular elements of information, which are geared towards their user’s self-disclosure within this imaginary media in order to further confirm its own value. Other affordances such as time travel allows users to collapse time in order to view not only their personality, but also the entirety of their lives,  through the app’s interdependent matrix of non-meanings. 

The app’s upcoming expansion into the dating services market is bound to be interesting and highly profitable (Kleeman 2019; Veiga 2020). With the Bonds section already subject to payment, it is clear that the app knows how to monetize its value, commodifying its insights and enthusiastic user base (York 2001). If popular, the dating ‘scene’ is sure to be profoundly transformed through the introduction of a new ‘techno- spiritual’ ethics and etiquette, it will be particularly fascinating to see how two such irrational forces, love and astrology, will be mediated in the social imaginary through the real-life application of The Pattern’s principles (Summers-Effler 2015).
